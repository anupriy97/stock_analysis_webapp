      "['\\nModerator', '  Ladies and gentlemen, good day, and welcome to Q 2 FY 25 Earnings Conference Call  of Titan \\nCompany  Limited . \\nAs a reminder, all participant lines will be in the listen -only mode and there will be an \\nopportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes. Should you need assistance \\nduring the conference call, please signal an operator by pressing “*” and then “0” on your \\ntouchtone phone. Please note that this conference is being recorded.  \\nI now hand the conference over to Mr. C. K. Venkataraman , Managing Director from Titan \\nCompany  Limited . Thank you and over to you, sir.  \\nC. K. Venkataraman ', \" Thank you  very much. Good evening, everyone on the call. It's good to join you immediately \\nafter a wonderful Diwali. Happy Diwali belated to all of you. And we are  also happy to do this \\ncall on top of a good growth quarter in Q2.  I would like to circle back at the end of the call to \\ngive my broader comments on the Company  and the various parts.  \\nNow , I can hand it  over to the people who would like to ask us questions, please.  \\nModerator\", '  Thank you very much. We will now begin the question -and-answer  session.  Anyone who wishes \\nto ask a question may press star and one on your touchtone phone . If you wish to remove yourself \\nfrom the question queue, you may press star and two. Participants are requested to use handsets \\nwhile asking the questions. Ladies and Gentlemen, we will wait for a moment while the question \\nqueue assembles . The first question is from the line of Devanshu B ansal from Emkay Global, \\nplease go ahead.  \\nDevanshu Bansal', '  Thanks for the opportunity, and congratulations on a good growth performance in Q2. My first \\nquestion is on margin, Sir. In the jewellery segment , there has been a 270  bps margin drop. I just \\nwanted to understand if you could segregate this into various margin brackets. Is it like due to a \\npressure in gold price margin , weaker revenue mix or higher promotions on making char ge \\nmarketing , etc., So, broadly if you could help us understand the breakup of the this? \\nAjoy Chawla', \"  Hi, this is Ajoy here. We had two -three impacts on margin this quarter.  \\nOne was a substantial part of it is on account of the one -time custom duty loss, which has flown \\nin already part of it in this quarter and partly in the next. That's a substantial part of it. Beyond \\nthat, it is to do with the studded mix being lower than t he expected one , again on account of two \\nfactors. One is there was a gold rush of sorts in quarter two. Therefore, the gold component was \\nmuch higher, including a substantial rise in gold coins and bullion purchases. And the other is, \\nin studded , Solitaire , particularly the large carat stone demand  has been under pressure due to \\nprice uncertainties  in the market , linked to international demand supply situation. So, all these \\nthree factors actually contributed to most of the reasons for the margin drop. Some amount of  \\nmarketing investments for the brand , etc., to drive growth , would have contributed, but that's not \\nsubstantial. That would be a very small impact.  \\nAshok Sonthalia \", ' And maybe we can just quantify Ajoy custom duty impact in the quarter is Rs. 290 crores . \\nDevanshu Bansal', \"  Yes, that's mentioned in the PPT, Sir. Ajoy, I also wanted to understand the reason behind this \\nweak sort of growth in studded . Obviously, Solitaire, you mentioned. So, if we have to divide it \\ninto two broader reasons, one is from a studded perspective, the other competition is sort of \\ngiving relatively better pricing on studded . That is one.  And the second obviously is the growing \\nnoise around the lab grown diamond. So, what do you attribute this to as of now among these \\ntwo reasons?  \\nAjoy Chawla\", \"  So, as I said, the Solitaire demand has been a big contributor to the impact on overall studded . \\nIf I exclude Solitaire and look at the growth without Solitaire, actually the studded growth is \\nquite healthy. Okay. And even within Solitaires, I can further specify that the bigger stones  \\nwhere price uncertainty is high and where there is a certain investment mindset which exists for \\nthose people who are buying higher carat stones, one carat, two carat and so on and so forth, \\nthey have been holding back because they are waiting for prices t o settle down. Now, it is not \\nentirely clear is it because of lab grown, but it is also true that international demand in China and \\nmany other markets which have nothing to do with lab grown has also been on the back foot and \\ntherefore , there is a demand s upply issue on large size Solitaire stones. Competitive pressures \\nwise, I don't see a big issue because as I said studded jewellery demand has been good and in \\nfact buyer growth have been in healthy double digits across price bands . So, even the sub-1 lakh \\nprice band which some people might ask , so actually we are very happy with the buyer growth \\nin studded therefore more customers are in the market for studded.  \\nDevanshu Bansal\", '  Just a small follow up, what would be qualitatively the margin difference between Solitaires \\nwithin studded and the other smaller pieces that we sell under the studded jewellery?  \\nAjoy Chawla', '  No significant difference.  \\nModerator', '  Thank you. The next question is from the line of Tejas Shah from Avendus Spark Institutional \\nEquities. Please go ahead.  \\nTejas Shah', '  Hi, Thanks for the opportunity. Ajoy, t he first question is, with most categories, the consumer \\ncategories at large being soft this quarter, except our jewellery has actually done well at large \\neven as a sector, how do you gauge consumer sentiment? Any early read on festive  or wedding \\ndemand trends also?  \\nAjoy Chawla', \"  I think the consumer sentiment was good, I would say, in this quarter.  The only slight, let's say, \\nadjustment we have to make , last year, Shradh was in October, all of Shradh. This year, 13 days \\nout of the 15 days of Shradh was in September, so it kind of shifted quarters. And that, while we  \\nfactor it into our business plan, that when you look at it from a calendar perspective  may not \\nstrike you, and therefore, I see sentiment to be very good. Even festive sentiment has been \\nexcellent.  So, I think it's fantastic.  \\nTejas Shah\", '  And the same you would extend to wedding jewellery demand also?  \\nAjoy Chawla', \"  Yes, wedding jewellery demand started picking up post the custom duty reduction \\nannouncement because there were many fence -sitters which we believe from first quarter and \\nelection and all of those factors which impacted first quarter who were waiting. Once gold prices \\ncorrected,  many people came in. And as we speak also, because festive is a good period to also \\npick up  jewellery festive , wedding has picked up. And we think it's a good run a head for the next \\ntwo quarters.  \\nTejas Shah\", '  A small follow up there. So, with high gold prices, are you seeing any shift towards lighter or \\nmore affordable jewellery or any preference trending across price p oints or regions you can \\nshare?  \\nAjoy Chawla', \"  Actually, no. We have seen that higher value jewellery in gold, especially if I look at it, has \\ncontinued to do well.  In the very low-price  points , because of the price of gold having gone up, \\nsome products have moved price bands. So, on gold , I would say there is in fact no indication \\nthat it is only lightweight which people are interested in. It's pretty much what it is. In the \\ndiamond studded , there was some, but I think I am not sure if it's a consumer sentiment. I think \\nthe ticket size in studded was  impacted partly on account of Solitaire and partly on account of a \\ndelayed launch from our side in certain price bands. But I don't see any correlation coming out \\nthere. Lower price bands in diamonds have done very well, whether you look at Car atLane, \\nwhether you look at Tanishq or Mia. So, not seeing any trends.  \\nTejas Shah\", '  And the last one on lab grown diamonds, so we have been wait-and-watch or monitoring phase \\nfor last few quarters, as you called out. Any early findings on consumer interest now or any pilot \\ninitiativ es underway that you can share?  \\nAjoy Chawla', '  No, we continue to observe. We are not seeing inquiries across our stores other than clarifying \\nthat all the diamonds we are selling are natural , etc., We continue to observe and study the \\ncustomer and keeping a close track of it. So, as of now, nothing more to report.  \\nModerator', '  Thank you. The next question is from the line of Avi Mehta from Macquarie. Please go ahead.  \\nAvi Mehta ', ' Hi Team, Thanks for the opportunity. Just on the margin front , first, we have seen the first half \\nat almost about 11.3 % adjusted for this custom duty. Would you still look at 11 .5%-12.5% for \\nthe year? Is that a range that we can kind of, how should we look at FY25, if you could give us \\nsome sense?   \\nAshok Sonthalia ', ' Ashok here. I think given what we have done in H1 and the likely attraction of gold continuing, \\nI think FY25 looks like more between 11 % and 11.5 %. And then maybe we can come back that \\nare we going to go back to our original guidance for the next year.  \\nAvi Mehta ', ' And just a second question is on, again, sorry, on lab -grown diamond.  I hear you clearly on the \\nconsumer adoption. I just wanted to appreciate that  within the Tata Group, one other Company  \\nhas launched lab-grown d iamond. Does that indicate or preclude any possible entry by us? Or \\nhow should we look at that  or would love to hear your thoughts on th e same?  \\nC. K. Venkataraman ', \" Hi Avi, Venkat here. Trent is a big box r etailer and Westside  sells multiple categories. So, they \\nsell perfumes, Titan sells perfumes, they sell women's bags, Titan sells women's bags and salwar \\nkameez  and so on. So, in a way, it is natural for a big box retailer to consider fashion jewellery  \\nand the introduction / use of the lab -grown diamonds in the fashion jewellery . We are a category \\nexpert, we create brands, we create EBOs and we play the game very differently. And both of \\nus are free to pursue our own destinies. I think because the lab -grown diamond is a strategic \\nsubject in the jewellery  industry, obviously this question is raised as opposed to perfumes and \\nbags, I understand that. But it certainly does not preclude us at all from doing anything that we \\nwant.  It is just that we choose to do our business in a partic ular way  and this is a matter of such \\nstrategic importance that we would announce it when we are ready to announce it. That  is all.  \\nAvi Mehta \", ' And Sir, just to clarify, if I heard your comment correctly, the current performance of non -\\nsolitaire studded jewellery  reaffirms our expectations. That  is the right read through on how we \\nlook at lab -grown? \\nAjoy Chawla ', ' Yes. The non -solitaire side of the demand is very good and healthy. Even soli taires, the smaller \\ncarats  are actually doing very well. There are carats  where the investment -oriented buyer is there \\nwho is waiting and watching  and that  is what customers have also told us.  \\nAvi Mehta ', ' And Sir, any share that you could share of how rou ghly it would be in salien ce for us, t he large \\ndiamonds because I would assume it would be a little bit smaller share ? \\nAshok Sonthalia ', ' It is a fairly small share , but in the recent past we had upped the game in the last 2-3 years , so \\nwe had clocked in very good growth so the base effect has played a role . Otherwise , it is a small \\nshare.  \\nModerator ', ' Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ja y Doshi from Kotak. Please go ahead.  \\nJay Doshi ', ' Hi, Thanks for the opportunity. Just clarifying on the guidance for EBIT margin, the earlier \\nguidance was 11 .5%-12.5% at the consol jewellery  EBIT margin. So, has this now changed to \\n11%-11.5%?  Basically, it  is consol jewellery  EBIT or standalone?   \\nAshok Sonthalia ', ' So, yes, you must appreciate that the Titan jewellery  is the significant part of that. So, whatever \\napplies to T anishq  would actually hold true for the consolidated also. So, it is overall.  \\nJay Doshi ', ' So, if I look at the first hal f numbers, recurring consol EBIT  margin is 10 .5% for jewellery  \\nbusiness. And for you to sort of deliver 11 .5%, it means the second half should be 11 % at  a \\nlower end , second half should be 100 bps better than first half , so are there any sort of efficiency \\nlevers or any trends that you  are seeing in the market that gives you confidence of improvement \\nin second half, margin improvement versus what we  have seen in first half. And I  am referring \\nto recurring, excluding onetime impact of import  duty? \\nAshok Sonthalia ', ' No, I understand, So , some of the initiatives which have been taken on and they are in the early \\nstage or some are slightly advanced stages , kind of makes us believe that some improvement we \\ncan do , even like diamond  jewellery , the gold content and the inherent margin of that stuff have \\ngone down slightly, may slightly stabilize. And even quarter 3 and quarter 4, likely performance \\nwhich we think, including CaratL ane, CaratLane  also margin trajectory would be slightly better \\nin H2, for sure. And that is what gives us confidence in H2, we will be slightly better off than \\nH1. \\nAjoy Chawla ', ' I will just supplement , on the demand side , we have always maintained that this year, quarter 1 \\nwould be the weakest because of the many factors at play. We spoke about it. H2 is therefore \\nexpected to be certainly better than H1 and certainly for diamond stud ded, even more so. And \\nthat gives us the confidence that it would be a better margin play in H2.  \\nJay Doshi ', \" And is it possible so  when we look at this quarter's margin of 11.4 % versus 14.1 % last year, \\nthere is a 270 basis point drop. And when we look at 1Q, the drop was actually not that much on \\na Y-o-Y basis  and 1Q was  a much weaker quarter from topl ine growth or operating leverage \\nperspective. So, is it possible to break down this 270 basis point recurring EBIT margin drop \\nthis quarter? How much of that is attributable to, let  us say, weakness on the stud ded side or \\nmix? An d how much of that is basic ally competitive pressure in the gold business ? \\nAjoy Chawla \", ' Most of it is the studded product mix and studded product mix and gold coin mix also being  \\nthere  and some of it , as Ashok pointed out , the gold price component in the total material cost \\nof the studded piece also adds up into that and therefore it is really linked to studded share , not \\nso much on the competitive  margin.  Studded margin will get impacted, therefore on that gold \\nprice going up and product mix on account of stud ded share and gold coin share. These are the \\nthree factors beyond.  \\nJai Doshi ', ' As a thumb rule, my understanding was 100 bps drop in studd ed share would account for about \\n20 bps impact on margin. Is that correct or you think it will be much higher?  \\nAshok Sonthalia ', \" We can't confirm that  because product level margin discussion we don't do.   \\nModerator \", ' Thank you. Next question is from the line of Percy from IIFL. Please go ahead.  \\nPercy ', ' I had a question on consumer behavior. So, supposing if there is a consumer with a budget of let  \\nus say 1 lakhs to 1.5  lakhs who wants to buy diamond jewellery , and supposing this customer is \\nnow saying that, okay, let me evaluate a jewellery  made from lab -grown diamonds, then what \\ndoes he do in this situation?  Does he buy similar type of jewellery  by slashing his budget or does \\nhe more or less maintain his budget and upgrade the quality or rather the caratage of the \\ndiamonds?  \\nAjoy Chawla ', \" It is a very hypothetical question. I  will try to answer it in the most factual way I can. ₹1-₹. 2 \\nlakhs price segment has seen fantastic buyer growth for Tanish q in this quarter a nd it continues. \\nSo, I sense that customer is not swinging too much. If it was, we would have started seeing some \\nweakness. Second piece of information that I have picked up from whatever consumer \\nunderstanding and market work  is the moment lab -grown jewellery  goes beyond ₹1,00,000, the \\ncustomer interest significantly falls. In fact, most of the players are selling products  largely in \\nthe sub  ₹1 lakh space and maybe ₹50,000, ₹60,000, ₹70,000. There is a segment of people at the \\nvery top end who might be asking their jeweler to give them a la b-grown in big stones, which \\nmay be in that ₹10-₹15 lakhs. That  is it. It  is difficult to estimate that demand. But most of the \\nplayers tha t you see in the marketplace are selling pretty much sub -one lakh. So, I think beyond \\none lakh, there  is a barrier in the customer's mind is my understanding from whatever I’ve picked \\nup. \\nPercy \", ' So, let us say supposing there is a customer who wants to buy in that ₹1-₹1.5 lakh ticket size and \\nsupposing , I know you said that he is unlikely to go to lab -grown diamonds , but supposing he \\nwants to buy a very similar piece made through lab -grown diamonds , then how much does he \\nactually  save on his budget ? Does that  ₹1.5 lakh become  ₹50,000 or does it become ₹1 lakh? \\nWhat is the rough  ballpark here ? \\nAjoy Chawla ', ' It will be below ₹50,000.  \\nPercy ', ' So, basically even at a ₹1.5 lakh ticket size which is a studded jewellery  which means that there \\nare multiple pieces of diamonds in it, even at that poin t he saves like 65% of his cost?  \\nAjoy Chawla ', \" I don't know whether he can get the same piece with the same stone configuration. He may be \\nable to get something at ₹50,000 - ₹60,000 which may not have exactly the same stone \\nconfiguration. It  is a very difficult hypothetical question.  But by and large , I think, the person \\nwould bring it, the budget would come down to ₹50,000, ₹60,000, maybe max ₹70,000  or maybe \\nit would be ₹50,000. \\nC. K. Venkataraman \", ' And for what it is worth, to answer your first question in the American market, the general \\ntendency of people is to buy a much bigger product for the budget that they came with. So, if it \\nis $10,000 , so I would buy a much bigger stone  for the $10,000 and in a way make myself and  \\nmy bride to be happy with that bigger stone. And that  is the tendency in the US as opposed to \\nbuy a similar product at one -third the price.  \\nPercy ', ' So, if that is the case, Venkat, then what stops us from getting into this segment? Because my \\nunderstanding is what  is stopping us is the value depletion that if we start offering LGD, the \\ntopline itself will suffer even if the volume goes up , but if the topline is more or less maintained \\nand the gross margins anyways are quite healthy on LGD, then what is the detriment in you \\nlaunching this product?  \\nC. K. Venkataraman ', ' Why do you think anything is stopping us from getting into this? We have not yet launched.  \\nModerator ', ' Thank you. The next question is from the line of Nihal Mahesh from Ambit Capital. Please go \\nahead.  \\nNihal Mahesh ', ' I have my first question on the demand with Ajoy, the press release mentioned that there was \\nstrong momentum till mid -September. Just wanted to clarify that after the initial spurt that you \\nsaw post the duty cut, has the demand trend sustained or there has been a sharp moderation , just \\nwanted to clarify that part first ? \\nAjoy Chawla ', ' No, it  is sustained. I would only say that there was a pause during the Shradh  period which \\nstarted around the 17th of Sept ember till the end of the month and actually till 2nd of October. \\nFrom 3rd onwards, again, it picked up. Of course, this excludes Bengal because they start their \\nPujo purchases. But after that, it  has continued well into the season.  \\nNihal Mahesh ', ' Understood, that’s clear. The second question was again on the LGD bit. As you als o \\nhighlighted, based on what we hav e discussed in this call, that the demand for LGDs is mainly \\nthe sub  ₹1 lakh price point at this point in time.  And more than Tanish q, I think Car atLane \\noperates in that point with a very high share of solitaires. So, is it right to say the kind of a \\ncustomer that a Car atLane serves and also say if LGD becomes more fashion oriented, that is \\nthe brand which could see maybe more migration of customers, and maybe that  is the brand \\nwhere LGD launch would make sense , just your thoughts on that?  \\nC. K. Venkataraman ', ' Actually, we wouldn’t  like to share anything about our strategy, whatever that is, when it is \\ngoing to be on this. Actually, if you really think about it, it  is a matter of strategy that you  are \\nasking us to rev eal before we actually launch anything like that, right? So, like I said earlier on \\nthe call, we would speak about it in detail when we are ready to speak about it.  \\nAshok Sonthalia ', \" Just one factual correction that Car atLane doesn't have , it looks like you said that they are selling \\na lot of solitaire.  \\nNihal Mahesh \", ' Studded.   \\nAjoy Chawla ', ' So, let me also just reiterate another point. Carat Lane growth has been fantastic in this quarter. \\nMia growth has been fantastic in this quarter. Tanish q sub ₹1 lakh studded growth has been \\nfantastic this quarter. And overall buyer growth also has been in early double digits, which is \\nvery good for stud ded. So, there is no current sense that this is getting impacted, if that  is the \\nhypothesis you have . \\nNihal Mahesh ', ' So, I will just correct. Maybe it is not about this quarter and lot about the impact, but just that \\nwould that customer be more relevant from an LG D perspective, let  us put it that way, rather \\nthan a Tanish q customer ? \\nAjoy Chawla ', ' Very difficult to comment, because right now there is no data to give evidence on that front, not \\njust now, over the last several quarters.  And this question has been coming and this hypothesis \\nseems to be alive since the last several quarters almost continuously and currently the data is not \\nshowing up.  \\nModerator ', ' Thank you.  Ladies and Gentlemen, in order to ensure that the Management is able to answer \\nquestions of all participants, please limit your questions to two per participant.  If you have a \\nfollow -up qu estion, you may rejoin the queue.  The next question is from the line of Shirish \\nPardes hi from Centrum Broking. Please go ahead.  \\nShirish Pardes hi', ' Hi, Good evening. Thanks for the opportunity. Ajoy,  just two observations. Our studded ratio \\nhas come down to 30 % and in Tanish q it has grown about 12 % while in the CaratLane what I \\nam reading is about the growth is about 41 %. So, is the nature of the business, w hat I am trying \\nto understand is there any overlap of the customers between CaratLane and Tanishq and what \\nyou mentioned is the shift which is happening from say a particular customer who  is buying say \\nless than ₹1 lakh studded at Tanishq is now moving to CaratLane ? \\nAjoy Chawla ', ' So, we do look at it as a portfolio. And in sub  ₹1 lakh studded as I s aid, the portfolio is growing \\ndouble digits in terms of buyer growth. And the growth in CaratLane is certainly high because \\nof the expansion that has happened in the past and will continue to be showing higher growth. It  \\nis also a much smaller base. In the case of Tanishq,  there is no reason to believe because even \\nTanishq  has a large dependence on the sub  ₹1 lakh st udde d number of buyers. And we have seen \\nactually good buyer  growth even for Tanish q and Mi a, which is there in Tanish q stores as well \\nas Mia as a channel by itself. So, there may be some flow here and there that keeps happening, \\nbut it  is very difficult to quantify that. We have not really got into that level of depth. We do \\nlook at it as an overall portfolio.  Saumen wants to further add.  \\nSaumen Bhaumik', \"  Saumen  here, Carat Lane's play is by and large in the sub -50k, if you look at the real price point -\\nbased segment. So, it is not even at ₹1,000,000. It is significantly below ₹1,000,000  and ₹30,000 -\\n₹50,000 would be the max of our product that we sell.   \\nShirish Pardes hi\", ' The reason why I  am saying I had a first -hand experience around Diwali. So, we went  a nearby \\nstore which was next to Car atLane  and we saw a  lot of people around Car atLane  and people \\nwere completely buying only gold from Tanish q. Is there is a segmentation happening within \\nthe consumer minds? That  is my fear . \\nC. K. Venkataraman', '  Actually, there are multiple angles sitting here. First of all, Car atLane is Tanishq . Secondly, \\nCaratLane is so famous for  good looking affordable jewellery . Tanish q is so famous for exquisite \\njewellery . And the first thing you think of Tanish q is not good looking affordable. That  is not \\nTanish q. Tanish q plays, when you ask so much about the wedding, for example, or if you take \\nthe campaign of Tanish q for Diwali, it  is Nav-raani, which is exclusive big jewellery . So, natural \\nplace for  customers to go for affordable good looking jewellery  would be a Ca ratLane or a Mia  \\nand therefore you will see a lot more people sort of crowding in that store and in a small store , \\n10 people will look crowded. In a big store 20 people will look not so crowded. So, that is also \\nthere. But the more important thing is what the brand is famous for  and why people buy , a lot of \\ngifting happens in Car atLane. All these are there as dimensions.  \\nAjoy Chawla', '  And gold , season time gold is a very big draw.  The play of gold in Tanish q is far higher than the \\nplay of gold in Car atLane or Mia for that matter. It is completely the other way. So, there will \\nbe a crowd  for gold always.  \\nShirish Pardes hi', ' Just one quick follow up on Jewellery . Venkat, what is the new buyer contribution or new buyer \\ngrowth because you have giv en total buyer growth  at 12%?  \\nAjoy Chawla ', ' Total, the contribution of new to repeat  in the current quarter continues to be similar as last year. \\nThe growth is around the same, around the same percentage that we have seen , so both have \\ngrown at the same rate.  \\nShirish Pardes hi', ' Second and last question to Suparna , Watches, we have seen that Analog is doing much faster \\nand last 2-3 quarters it  is double digit , so is th ere a particular trend or is there particular product \\ninnovation or mix we have tried to showcase to the consumer? And how long will this growth  \\ncontinue? Do you think this is now in the base?  \\nSuparna Mitra', '  Suparna here, you  are right. Analog is seeing good growth in the last few quarters,  and it is on \\nthe back of very strong product design and innovation. Also,  on premiumization, so if you  see, \\nTitan brand or the Helios chain or the inter national brands doing very well, t he premium sub -\\nbrands like Nebula, Edge, etc. , doing very well. So, this has been going on for a while and this \\ntrend is becoming stronger and it is really getting manifested in very well -designed collections \\nwith very good  value for the consumer for that price point and also supported by very good \\nexecution both in our stores, on -ground stores as well as in the play that we have in online. So, \\nit is a combination of many things coming together and we do believe that our product pipeline \\nand the overall product strategy will keep delivering good results for the next few quarters.   \\nShirish Pardesi', '  I Got that, Does that mean that 14.9% EBIT margin what we have shown there is upside to this \\nmargin?  \\nSuparna Mitra', '  Difficult to say , I would go back to what we had said during the investor day that 13 %-14% is \\ndefinitely in the range that we will commit to.  \\nModerator', '  Thank you. The next question is from the line of Krish Shanbhag, an Individual Investor. Please \\ngo ahead.  \\nKrish Shanbhag', '  Sir, my question is on the loss due to import duty cut. Historically, you have always said that \\nyou hedge your gold, so there is no impact of falling gold prices. So, why is there a loss when \\nyou have hedged yourself?  \\nAshok Sonthalia ', ' So, we will try to explain. We source a lot of gold through Gold on Lease program, which is a \\nnatural hedge  because price is fixed on the date of sale. So, that gold inventory is in a way price -\\nwise not exposed, but custom duty is already paid. The day we source that gold on lease, custom \\nduty is paid, but the price is fixed on the date of sale , so that inventory is always exposed to \\ncustom duty variation.  In the past, sometime, when custom duty went up, we made some gains \\nalso. And that al so, if you go in our quarterly results, you will find that we have talked about \\nthat. This time, the drop was very steep, and that is why a significant loss.  \\nC. K. Venkataraman', \"  So, just to elaborate and make it totally clear, if ₹100 was the import rate, and ₹15 was the \\ncustoms duty paid;  we paid the ₹15, but that  ₹100 was floating till we fixed it  which we typically \\nmatch with sale. So, if ₹100 became ₹105, we sold it at ₹105, fixed it at ₹105, no loss , but the \\n₹15 was ₹15, and we couldn't hedge that 15 separately. And if the ₹15 fell to ₹6 as it fell, ₹9 we \\nhad to lose; we ended up losing.  \\nModerator\", '  Thank you. The next question is  from the line of Sourav Mondal from RK Advisory. Please go \\nahead.  \\nSourav Mondal', '  My question is about Analog watches. What is the trend there and if you could give some sense \\nabout pri ce category trend  and last 3 years and going forward, what is the revenue share of analog \\nto wearable s category?  \\nSuparna Mitra', '  So, the trend is, like I mentioned earlier, there is a very clear premiumization trend where \\nwatches above ₹ 5,000,  ₹10,000, ₹15,000, etc ., are doing very well. We are seeing good  growth \\nin, like I said brand Ti tan, which is kind of spearheading the growth. As far as the proportion of \\nanalog to wearables, the last couple of years we have seen wearables share go up, b ut now with \\nthe wearables market in a bit of a correction mode, we are seeing that the analog share is higher.  \\nModerator', '  Thank you. The next question is from the line of Aditya Soman from CLSA. Please go ahead.   \\nAditya Soman', \"  Hi, Good Afternoon . Two questions , so firstly, in terms of steady -state margins for jewellery , \\nwhat would be sort of a steady -state margin one should expect over a medium term? And has \\nthe guidance on that changed at all?  And the second question is on these emerging businesses. \\nWe see the level of profitability even on a year -on-year basis hasn't improved slightly. So, how \\ndo you think the trajectory on profitability plays out over the next few years, and what should \\nbe the drivers for improvement?  \\nAshok Sonthalia \", ' So, emerging businesses for sure are in the investment phase.  Growth is far more important than \\nmargin, but as the scale is growing, some of the gross margins are improving, so they can, but I \\nthink we are right now focused on them achieving the right scale and rightful position in the \\nmarket. Jewellery , as we answered earlier, for FY25, we think 11 %-11.5% seems to be the band \\nwhich we will be able to deliver.  And then at the end of the year and beginning of next financial \\nyear, we will be able t o have much more clarity that going forward, what kind of number can be \\ndelivered  and then maybe we will. But no significant change in terms of the structure is \\nhappening, 11.5 %-12.5% to now we have talked about right now 11 %-11.5%. So, we might go \\nback to the original  band, b ut ye s, we will wait for some more time to kind of give that guidance.  \\nModerator', '  Thank you. The next question is f rom the line of Siddhant Dand from Goodwill. Please go ahead.  \\nSiddhant Dand', '  Sir, my first question was about there  has been a proposal to hike GST on luxury watches, about \\n₹25,000, I think. So, what percentage of our sales would that be? And secondly, would it hamper \\nour plans to open ultra luxury watches  stores in Helios?  \\nSuparna Mitra', '  So, right now, it is  a proposal. I think the group of ministers has recommended to the GST \\nCouncil.  So, we will have to wait and see how it actually pans out. Our proportion of watches \\nabove ₹25,000 is not very high right now. But given the fact that premiumization is a very \\ncontinuing trend, it will become higher and higher over the next few years.  \\nSiddhant Dand', '  Would you give a rough band of what percentage of topline would those be?  \\nSuparna Mitra', '  At this point, we  will not be able to share.  \\nSiddhant Dand', '  Secondly, my question was regarding our golden harvest, competitors have come up with a little \\nmore aggressive scheme , so has that program been affected?  \\nAjoy Chawla', '  No, in fact, we ourselves have innovated a little bit on the golden harvest. We have launched \\nanother version which also enables customers to fix their gold rate, etc. , and the benefit is \\ndifferent from the Golden Harvest usual scheme.  So, put together, both p rograms are doing well \\nand enrollments have been good. We have not been impacted by whatever competitors have \\noffered. They have continued to offer historically , also more aggressively. So, it is not that \\nsomething new has happened .  \\nC. K. Venkataraman', '  And I think there is an intrinsic sort of relationship between preference for that brand and \\npreference for that Golden Harvest equivalent of that brand. People want to buy Tanish q, and \\npeople sign up with GHS . People want to buy some other brand, they sign up with the program \\nof that brand.  \\nSiddhant Dand', \"  My third and last question would be, one of our biggest moat was we were able to give a \\nKarameter  and verify people's adulterated gold back in the day. So, is there any sort of pilot or \\nany idea around identifying whether someone's jewellery  is a lab -grown one  versus  the mined \\none within the store itself?  \\nAjoy Chawla\", \"  Good idea. We should attempt it. We mentioned it in our media interaction when we did the De  \\nBeers tie -up. We have done a tie up. And we anyway use all their equipment for a lot of our \\nvalue chain to ensure that there is absolutely no contamination. And they themselves have also \\ninnovated and come out with more, let  us say,  smaller device, etc ., which can be deployed in \\nstores. So, we are going to experiment with some of this in some of the cities and see what it \\nyields. And we are also anyway separately testing out other competition and other jewelers' \\nproduct to see how much is truly natural, how much is mixed, etc. , so all that work is on , but \\ngood idea. We  will consider your thoughts.  \\nSiddhant Dand\", '  So, are you seeing on -ground adulteration going up in general?  \\nAjoy Chawla', \"  I don't have data for that right now. It  is too early to. We have started doing some studies. But \\nvery interestingly on gold, on a side note, even today we get 2-3 carats below the 22 carat in our \\nexchange program. And it surprises me now  and in certain markets, it goes down by even more, \\nfew more carat s. So, even after so many years of hallmarking and so many years of doing it, we \\nstill get very low carat s in our gold itself.  \\nModerator\", '  Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rahul from Anion  Investment Service. Please \\ngo ahead.  \\nRahul', '  Thank  you so much for taking my question  Sir. So, like in the last quarter, like we have data like \\nyou will be the expansion plan of the Tanish q, Mia and CaratLane  especially, so could you \\nprovide an update about the store expa nsion plans, especially how m any Tanishq, Mia and \\nCaratLane  stores have been added in Q2 and are you guys on track for their target , if the data is \\nhandy ? \\nAshok Sonthalia', '  Sure, So, we have added in Tanishq 22 stores. In fact, in this month itself, in October, we  have \\nadded another 10 or 11 stores, rather. We have added 33, therefore, up to 30th October  and our \\naim is to add between 40 and 50, depending on finding the right property, et c., and typically, \\nthat is what we  have added.  Mia is also likely to reach 250 by the end of the fiscal. On Car atLane, \\nSaumen  will share.   \\nSaumen Bhaumik', '  As far as Car atLane is concerned, we recently crossed a milestone of 300 stores. Currently, it is \\n301. Net addition is 29 for the year  and we hope to add another 20 before March.  \\nModerator', '  Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ashish Kanodia from Cit i. Please go ahead.  \\nAshish Kanodia', '  Thank you for the opportunity. The first question is on the competitive intensity. So, given the \\nsteep increase in gold price, if you can highlight how the regional and local players are behaving, \\nare they giving some offer on the gold price? Because we also noticed Tanis hq was offering \\ndiscount on the gold price for the first time  and post the discount, the gold price was matching  \\nthe gold price what some of the other large player offers. So, that is the first question ? \\nAshok Sonthalia', '  Yes, you  are right. The competitive intensity on gold rates itself has gone up . Thanks to the very  \\nhigh price of gold. And many local players have been either on their own or sometimes in \\nresponse to other national players or chains come out strongly with gold price offers.  And this \\nyear, we saw many players do that. So, we also decided to play it a little differently and ensure \\nthat our discount payouts during the festive season was smartly distributed between making \\ncharges and gold rate and other offers that we do. So, psychologically, it helped the customer \\nkind of feel a little bit more comfortable. But we still manage the payout i n a manner that we \\nlook at them in totality and therefore it  is not just a flow through.  \\nAshish Kanodia', '  So, instead of more discounts, part of the discount was routed through lower gold prices. Is that \\nthe right understanding?  \\nAshok Sonthalia', '  Yes. And what also it helped interestingly is during festive, the exchange became even more \\nattractive because people bring in their old gold at a certain rate  and then this is a discount, not \\nthe gold rate per se. So, it actually means in their mind, they gain a lot more by bringing in old \\ngold, and we wanted people to do a lot of that. So, we ran a festival of exchange as well during \\nthis period, and this played to that.  \\nAshish Kanodia', '  Sure Sir, that’s very helpful. The second question is, just going back on the LGD part, you have \\nseen over the years how CZ or ADs have kind of, instead of becoming a jewellery , it basically \\nended up being just a fashion access ories,  right , so any  learning from that or anything, when the \\nAD was ramping up in India, we were in a  very different zone, but any similarities or difference \\nyou see when ADs or CZ was  scaling up and now when LGD is scaling  up and  second, given \\nwhat a Westside has done and maybe some other places are also doing , we will see ultimately, \\nlab-grown diamond just fading away as accessories r ather than really replacing it as a jewellery ? \\nC. K. Venkataraman', \"  So, the first thing is that certainly LGDs are far superior to ADs in any other form, because \\noptically, chemically, physically, they mimic, they are diamonds in a sense, right? And they  are \\njust grown in the lab. So, to that extent, to compare them with AD is perhaps  not right. The other \\nthing is, finally, the sustainability side of  LGD is also an angle which is being brought in and all \\nthat. So, I won't compare it like that, but will have to actually see the way it plays out in the nex t  \\nmany years . It is not easy to predict how it will actually go. And your second part, wh at was it \\nto do with the Westside ? \\nAshish Kanodia\", '  My point was because if you are getting an LGD  in a big box retailer, as a consumer you will \\nnot necessarily see it as a jewellery , right? It ultimately becomes a fashion accessory . \\nC. K. Venkataraman', '  Correct. So, that was the point I was making about why the Westside  is choosing to do it like \\nthis and how it does not really impact  whatever we may do.  \\nAjoy Chawla', '  Also, what we have heard and seen  Pandora and Swarovski has gone into that space and how \\nthey shape that category and how it does and of course, prices coming down. So, you could be \\nright, but really very difficult to put a forecast on that.  \\nAshish Kanodia', '  Just one last bit is on the custom duty impact. So, last quarter, I think you called out that the total \\nimpact could be maybe between ₹500 - ₹550 crores  and g iven that the gold prices have actually \\nmoved up, my understanding is the impact could be slightly lower than that. So, is it significantly \\nlower to call it out separately that instead of ₹550 crores, the total impact could be lower?  \\nAshok Sonthalia ', ' No, actually, that was estimate, of course, at that point of time. And the gold prices going up \\nhave very little impact on that. So, actually our current  estimate,  which is much more firmer is \\nthat quarter 3 may witness about ₹275 - ₹280 crore s kind of number.  \\nModerator', '  Thank you. The next question is from the line of SL from Mehta’s Family Office. Please go \\nahead.  \\nSL', ' I have one question with regards to lab -grown diamonds. In the past, we  have seen something in \\nthe pearls. The pearls were considered as precious and luxurious jewellery , but, however, pearl \\nfarming changed the entire situation  and after the pearl lost all its charm, is lab -grown  doing the \\nsame to the mined diamonds?  \\nAjoy Chawla ', \" Your guess is as good as mine, to be honest. And frankly, it  is very difficult to predict what will \\nhappen. We can look at what happened in the US. So, it is very difficult to g auge . We  have also \\nhad that in emeralds. We  have also had that in rubies . But the same trend in play out, like it \\nplayed out in pearls, I don't know. Emeralds continue to be natural emeralds, and rubies continue \\nto be very important.  \\nModerator\", '  Thank you.  Next question is from the line of S aurabh  Patwa from Quest Investment Advisors. \\nPlease go ahead.  \\nSaurabh Patwa', '  Thanks for the opportunity Sir. I just wanted to have your thoughts on the rising gold prices and \\nlack of commensurate pricing increase in diamonds, in fact which has been falling. Do you see \\nrise of 18 carat  and below kind of jewellery  to make the products more, in terms of most of the  \\njewelers , making those products affordable as well as maintain their margin for the st udded  \\njewellery . Could this be a tren d we could see as we move ahead?  \\nC. K. Venkataraman', '  You are asking only for studded ? \\nSaurabh Patwa', '  Yes, l argely for studded, Sir. That is how you will make the jewelr ies lighter as well as the mix \\nfor your diamond and gold. Mix could be the proportion in terms of value could be maintained ? \\nSaumen Bhaumik', '  There is actually, this is S aumen  from CaratLane . There is actually enough evidence, especially \\nin the northern region and the western region, the high -value jewellery  of diamond has moved \\nto 14 carat  and it has happened over a period of time and it is actually a substantial segment of \\nthe higher end of diamond  jewellery . \\nAjoy Chawla', '  So, typically, also I  will clarify, most of the studded  jewellery  has been in 18 carat. There is a \\nsmall segment of 22 carat  studded jewellery  only in the South, which is a closed setting, which \\nit is called. That continues to be what it is. And 14 carat  is the other bit which, in fact, most of \\nMia is 14 carat a nd a good part of CaratLane is also 14 carat. And now what Saume n mentioned. \\nSo, whether 18 kt will become 14 kt as we go forward for the bulk of the market is difficult to \\nsay, because there are enough people who say, if I  am buying a diamond jewellery , and \\nespecia lly if it is in the ₹5,000,00 plus ₹8,000,00 plus, in certain markets, they are okay . If it is \\n14kt, in many markets, they are saying, no, it has to be 18 kt. So, it is not a very clear trend. It  is \\na mixed bag.  \\nC. K. Venkataraman ', ' Customer segments, like the  point that Aj oy was making about emeralds, there is something to \\nbe said , 18 carat  is closer to it being pure, in a sense  and therefore, when I  am buying something \\nexpensive, exquisite, I  woul d rather have that. It  is partly psychological, partly color, and all \\nthat. So, we are so much into 18 carat  diamond jewellery  and not 14  carat . \\nAjoy Chawla', '  To share with you, we keep experimenting in different markets and we keep learning from it. \\nAnd there is a geographic  preference/  difference that Sa umen also pointed out.  \\nSaurabh Patwa', '  And Sir, just second question, when you highlighted there is a price fall in the solitaire , how \\ndoes it work for the smaller diamonds that we use for our stud ded jewellery ? How has the pricing \\nbeen there? While selling you may not be explicitly mentioning that, but from your buying \\nperspective, those diamonds, how has the pricing been?  \\nAjoy Chawla', '  Pricing has been fairly stable. In fact, it has gone up post the Ukraine war because of Al-Rosa \\nsanctions, etc ., and therefore, there was a certain shortage of supply. Thereafter, it  has been \\npretty stable. There will always be deals going on here and there. In fact, we have not seen any \\nsoftness in that price in the smalls. Though Rapaport keeps publishing all kinds of data, but at \\nthe very small ones, their data reports are not really relevant. It  is mostly in the solitaires where \\nthe reports  are relevant . So, it is stable I would say.   \\nSaurabh Patwa', '  And lastly, just a quick clarification, you highlighted that you expect around ₹280 crores of \\ninventory loss because of custom duty. Is this included in your margin guidance?  \\nAshok Sonthalia ', ' No, margin guidance is always normalized. We have always clarified that this is one -time event. \\nMargin guidance, normalized guidance. So, you have to account for, adjust this ₹280 crores in \\nquarter 3.  \\nModerator', '  Thank you.  The next question is from the line of Sheela Rathi from Morgan Stanley. Please go \\nahead.  \\nSheela Rathi', '  Sir, first question was actually just in connection to the previous question. So, what was the key \\nreason for the EBIT margin improvement for Car atLan e this quarter? And should we expect the \\ntrend to continue to improve?  \\nSaumen Bhaumik', '  This is S aumen. Part of the reason is about the sales growth that has been significant.  Second \\nreason is also we have been able to hold the st udde d margin  and there has been also some \\nmarginal gain that would have come through the price of procurement, etc. , all these three. And \\nthe cost front, I think we have managed to contain our cost . All put together, we would have \\nseen about 1% plus delta over last year  and it is expected to be better.  \\nSheela Rathi', '  And second, Aj oy, for you, historically, you have guided us in terms of what the gold exchange \\nfor Tanish q jewellery  as well as non -Tanish q jewellery  has been. So, if you could update us on \\nthat number for this quarter  and additionally, if you can tell us if there is a similar number which \\nwe have with respect to diamond exchange  and if we have that number for this q uarter, it will \\nbe very helpful?  \\nAjoy Chawla', \"  I don’t have a number for diamond exchange, though it is an integral part of the Tanish q \\nexchange number which I have historically given. First on the gold exchange, which is non -\\nTanish q gold, t his quarter we saw a lower gold exchange, probably because I suppose people \\nsaw a good amount on gold and wanted to hold on to gold as much as they could. So, it is 3% \\npoint s lower contribution than usual.  And that  is what it looks like. But if I discount the sale of \\ncoins, because that is like buying co ins, then it  is a very marginal drop in contribution , then it  is \\nonly a 1% drop in contribution. So, it could be a very temporary  Q2 specific phenomena. And \\nin Tanish q exchange, significant part, not immaterial part , the material part of it comes also from \\nsolitaire exchange. That  has certainly reduced, especially at the higher end. I don't have a number \\nto give you on that. So, I am not able to share with you. But still, ballpark, we are in that 8% -\\n9%, sometimes it may swing to 10%, it may be 8% or 9%. I d on't have an exact figure right now.  \\nSheela Rathi\", '  And i f I may ask, can a customer who owns diamond jewellery , stud ded diamond jewellery , or \\na solitaire, can they exchange it for gold jewellery ? \\nAjoy Chawla', '  Yes.  \\nSheela Rathi', '  And just one final question , with respect to inventory, you attributed the customs duty related \\ninventory loss, but will we have any inventory loss with respect to solitaire in the upcoming \\nquarter?  \\nAjoy Chawla', '  No. \\nModerator', '  Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this was the last question for today. I now hand the conference \\nover to Mr. C. K. Venkat araman for closing comments.  \\nC. K. Venkataraman', '  Thank you very much everyone. So, like I started, it  has been a very satisfying quarter for us \\nfrom our growth point of view. And across businesses, it  has been quite satisfying. We  have \\nalready spoken about jewellery  and the analog watch business  and just spending a minute on the \\nanalog watch business, I think what the team has done and the division has done is actually focus \\nsubstantially on product innovation, retailing, branding and premiumization and we expect to \\npush the envelope o n this and continue this great trajectory for  many many years because this is \\nactually a product with limitless appeal. So, that is the long -term comment on watches.  \\nAs far as EyeCare is concerned , there was no question, but I want to clarify. I want to tell you \\nthat the strategy that we started executing about 8-9 months bac k continues to be in full swing \\nand the customer acquisition rate continues to be at a very satisfying level. People are so excited \\nabout the Titan Eye+  offering products , affordable fashion on the one hand, affordable \\nprogressive lenses on the other , premium frames and sunglasses on the third. So, across the \\nspectrum, we  are delivering exceptional,  refined product value and building a solid foundation \\nof growth over the next many quarters. And you  will hear about all this and the results in the \\nquarters to follow.  \\nThe foundation of Tane ira has become stronger and stronger and stronger.  And we expect \\ncertainly FY26 to be a sort of blockbuster year for Taneira. We aim to take it to its rightful place \\nin the ethnic wear industry and make it a very prominent, very  respected name in that market.  \\nWe are an established name in the perfume s business  and doing very well in H1 . The first \\nexclusive brand outlet of IRTH  was launched in October. It  is a fabulous store. All of you who \\nlive in Mumbai, please go to the Palladium Mall and take a look at this, an idea which is waiting \\nto explode  and you  will see the explosion of that across the country over the next many months. \\nAnd combined with the omni -potential for that category, we aim to make a big mark  in the \\norganizing, formalizing , right serving of tha t category as well.  \\nThe international business continues to be on a roll . First half as well as the October season were \\nvery very exciting. We are  opening stores by and large as per plan and everywhere hitting the \\nground running to exceptional customer acclaim.  And even the engineering business as one of \\nthe investors had messaged me about a week back , TEAL  is also doing very well. So, overall \\nthe portfolio of Titan Company  is in a very good place and thank you very much for all the  \\nsupport and confidence that you have put on us over the years and we hope to keep you delighted \\nin the quarters to come.  Thank you very much.  \\nModerator', '  Thank you. On behalf of Titan Company  Limited, that concludes this conference. Thank you for \\njoining us and you may now disconnect your lines.  ']\n"

The first question comes from the line of Aditya Soman from CLSA. Please go ahead. Aditya Soman: Hi, Good morning. So, two questions from me. Firstly, on jewellery, can you give us a sense of how you expect sort of margins to pan out? We've seen sort of a significant bump up in studded growth in the quarter. But if I look at the margins relative to the growth, at least the EBIT, growth still remains a little bit lower. So, I'm wondering if we see a further aspiration in the EBIT growth in 4Q normalized for this one-off inventory impact of the customs duty? And the second question on the Analog watches, I think, again, a very strong growth here. Do you see yourself sort of also building out sort of more lower-end Analog watches to drive faster and sort of more broader growth in that category? Ajoy Chawla: Yes. I'll go first. I'm Ajoy, I'll go first on the jewellery margins. Yes, it's been a very good quarter and for studded as well. Now what happened in this quarter is that the rate at which gold is growing, is kind of exceeding significantly the rate at which studded is going. And in our minds, we see them as two independent opportunities, and therefore we maximize growth on both fronts.  \""

Gold coins, particularly in Q3, which is normally very high in that festive quarter, but this time it was even further, perhaps reflective of the high gold -- interest in gold as an investment instrument given the way gold prices have been going. So that's one big factor. This is beyond the custom duty one-time impacts of -- in the quarter. The second big factor that is playing out is, there is a certain dilution in the GC percentages for studded, largely because of this unprecedented rise in gold price. I had explained this earlier in our previous call, maybe previous couple of calls I think, that when the relative weight of gold versus diamonds in the studded product category by itself changes, thanks to the price rise in gold, given the differential margins we earn on gold or stones, there is an impact of this gold price on the overall GC studded percentages.  As a consequence, with spiralling gold prices, there is likely to be some impact on the line-item level GC studded. And therefore, that also shows up. So, these are the two main factors which have played up in quarter 3, and we believe this could continue to play. It's very difficult to predict, given the way gold prices have been swinging upward even in the month of Jan and Feb, thanks to whatever is happening in the US and the dollar is going up.

So, we are seeing, of course, very good growth in the premium segment. In our premium brands like Edge, Nebula, Xylys, we have seen  \\nmore than 50% growth. But I'm also happy to note that we are seeing very good growth in brands like Fastrack and Sonata, which are in the more affordable space.  And in Q3, for example, we've seen 33% growth in Fastrack and 24% growth in Sonata, which is about a lot of product and restaging and new products. So, the product strategy is working well in terms of the value and the fashion offered at those price points. Titan, which is the flagship brand, and Raga continue a very good growth. So unlike maybe a year – year and half back, when we were seeing good growth in the premium, but the economy ranges were not performing well, now we are seeing both the engines, premium continuing to do very well and even our more affordable brands are doing better. Aditya Soman\", \" Thank you. That's very clear, Suparna. And just one follow-up, Ajoy. So, the diamond prices on your own wouldn't have come off, right? I mean, on diamonds specifically? I mean I understand the gold mix going up and the price of gold going up?  Ajoy Chawla\", ' No, we have not seen that. Whatever has happened, has happened in big stones, that too at the wholesale price level. So, we are not seeing any diamond price dilution per se. Aditya Soman', ' That’s very clear. Thank you. Moderator', ' Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Abneesh Roy from Nuvama Wealth. Please go ahead. Abneesh Roy', \" Thanks. My first question is on the Emerging Business. Ideally for any company, emerging business should be the fastest growth. And unfortunately for you, it seems to be the slowest growth. And we have seen only 1 store addition in Taneira, and Taneira growth is flat. So, is Taneira the only reason behind the slow growth?  And in Taneira, do you need to go back to the drawing board in terms of pricing, design, etcetera? And would you go slow until you figure out what's happening there? Because in marriage season, ideally Taneira should have seen a good growth. Ambuj Narayan\", \" Hi Abneesh, thank you for that question. Ambuj, here. Yes. So, you're right. Taneira's sales growth was flattish. But if you look at our retail growth, we grew by 30% and our buyer growth was 38%. The reason why it looks flattish is because last year we had opened seven L3 stores in quarter 3, and whereas this year we opened only one L3. And we also allowed for some inventory correction in some L3 stores. Having said that, we have also introduced a lot of new products at accessible price points across sarees and non-saree segment, which was received very well by our customers, both existing and new, and that actually brought down our AUCP (Average  \\nConsumer Price), but it delivered the required buyer growth, though I think we could have done better if we had gotten more new buyers. So that's what we are working on right now.  We opened only one store in this quarter, but we are continuing to -- we'll continue to open stores. Now we are focusing more on metros and Tier-1 cities, and not going to smaller towns. So, there has been a small change in our strategy, and we would like to populate more stores in the existing and operational cities. Abneesh Roy\", ' One quick follow-up on watches. So good numbers. So how much of these good numbers in terms of double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion is because of the marriage season? And next two quarters, also marriage season is strong. And second is, would you see the wearables declining sharply for you and industry as a blessing in disguise, because there was no big right to win there and clearly customer fatigue is also very high. And your right to win in Analog and premium is much, much superior and much stronger. So, do you see that as a blessing in disguise? Suparna Mitra', \" So, I'll take the first question first. Yes watches, Analog watches are very large component (in gifting). Our estimate in retail is more than 50% is for gifting. And we know a large part of that is for wedding. So, weddings do have a direct correlation, especially in the higher-priced watches. In fact, interestingly, you would imagine that watches bought for wedding / gifting are lower priced than for self, but we have actually seen there is no difference. So, wedding season does have a good correlation, and I think that, along with a slew of very attractive new products, should work in our favour. The second question is on wearables. So yes, the category was led by a certain paradigm, and of course now we see a very big correction in the category. And we are actually at the place when we are re-looking at our strategy and playing to our strength, which is a lot of consumer centricity, design, product, trust, assurance, quality, access of customers through our channel and higher price points. And I think that strategy has already started seeing some green shoots. We should be able to implement and see the results in the next, I'd say, 6 to 18 months. Abneesh Roy\", \"  So, thanks. That's all from my side. Thank you. Moderator\", ' Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Avi from Macquarie. Please go ahead. Avi', \" Hi, team. Thanks a lot for this opportunity. So, I just wanted to kind of follow up on the studded jewellery margin aspect. So where are we in the journey for normalization  \\nof the studded jewellery margin? And how long do you see that kind of taking to kind of reach there?  Because you did allude towards making adjustments in the product portfolio, and where I'm trying to get to is this 11.0% - 11.5%, when do you see it kind of moving to 11.5% to 12.0%, which is historically the margin range that we've been able to achieve on a steady state basis? That's my first question. And I'll come back to the watch segment for the second question. Ajoy Chawla\", \" Sure. Thanks, Avi. So, I think it's actually becoming very difficult to predict how the gold rate will continue moving and how much it will continue to move. If it accelerates at the rate at which it is going, sometimes 5% within a month itself, it becomes extremely challenging. Overall, if you see over the last 1 year, it's a 25% jump in gold price. And diamond prices have remained where they are. So consequently, the weighted average material mix, material cost mix, is swinging quite a bit. And all initiatives that we can take, it's not going to swing it overnight like this. It takes time. And the product mix is also -- one is what we put out there; the other is also what customers prefer. So many complex forces. And I'm sorry, I'm probably giving you a roundabout answer, but GC on studded, where it will stabilize, when it will stabilize, is slightly difficult to predict. What we do look at is how the total GC growth in studded is happening or how the total GC growth for studded plus gold plus coins is happening quarter-to-quarter, year to year, and over the next 2 to 3 years. So therefore, these percentages, which perhaps play a significant role in your predictions, hold lesser weightage in our workings because we have to maximize on all fronts. And therefore, whether it's 11.0% to 11.5%, when it will move up on account of operating leverage, that question also becomes difficult because we are constantly also investing back in growth, because we are prioritizing growth given the headroom and the opportunity and the single-digit market share that we have and the formalization forces in India opportunity. We think it would be appropriate to chase growth over margins. And in a way, that has been our enduring strategy. C.K. Venkataraman\", \" Also continuing to deliver exceptional customer value, defending and increasing share in individual cities and states and delivering a really leading class shareholder returns. So, it's actually that is the combination that Ajoy is referring to while growing. So that's the perspective you should have on that. Ajoy Chawla\", \" And just one more element. We focus also a lot on two other aspects of growth. One is buyer growth because that is volume for us and that's very critical top of the funnel.  \\nAnd the second, buyer growth again by gold and studded independently. And the other thing that we focus a lot on is same-store growth because that's what really gives the kicker in many ways, even while our expansion plans continue. C.K. Venkataraman\", \" Because one of the unusual things in this category it may not be that apparent, that while everyone by and large, at least the people that we compete with are all marked in the making charges for example in gold dissolved in percentage terms, but as the price of gold keeps rising, a 5% difference between us and another leading player, let's say, in Delhi, the 5% translates to a higher and higher amount every day or every month, every week.  And it's not -- customers don't simply see it only as 5%. It is now ₹ 200, ₹ 500, ₹ 1,000 and so on and so forth, that difference. And therefore, we have to do a lot of juggling to continue to deliver to customer. So, it's quite a complex type of work that the business has to do to deliver to multiple stakeholders.  Moderator\", ' Thank you. Ladies and Gentlemen, we request you to restrict to two questions per participant. The next question comes from the line of Devanshu Bansal from Emkay Global. Please go ahead. Devanshu Bansal', ' Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on a very good quarter. Ajoy, jewellery SSG has clearly improved from 15% in Q2 to 22% in Q3. We have not seen a secular uptick in SSG trends for other listed peers where they are either similar or slightly lower versus Q2.  So just wanted to check on what corrective actions have you taken to see this growth improvement and how sustainable are these growth initiatives? Ajoy Chawla', ' I think we focused a lot on, as I said buyer growth is one story. And in this quarter particularly if you ask me what has helped is ticket size growth, particularly in gold because of the upswing on wedding-related purchases and occasion purchases. Even in studded while we saw healthy buyer growth -- in fact, the buyer growth in studded was healthier than that in gold, much healthier rather I would say.  But the value growth in studded has also got an additional kicker, thanks to a lot of high-value studded sales, where we are seeing very good traction. We did a lot of exhibitions of special collections, red carpet, etcetera. We also did a lot of activity around wedding collections. We had the launch of Tarun Tahiliani and Rivaah collab 2.0.  And a lot of exhibitions and customer outreach, especially to these high-value customers has happened which has resulted in fairly good ticket size growth, which comes typically from repeat customers. So yes, how sustainable it is? Well, our efforts  \\nare sustainable. We will continue to put efforts, how much the customer response is also not entirely in our hands, but we continue to push both on buyer and ticket size growth even in this quarter and the quarters ahead. Devanshu Bansal', ' Second, I wanted to understand this there has been a sourcing loophole that has been plugged by the government in the budget where gold was being imported in the form of alloy. Do you feel this was happening in pretty large quantities and which can lead to some reduction in competitive intensity from a gold pricing point of view? Ajoy Chawla', ' Difficult to comment. C.K. Venkataraman', \" Since we are not part of that kind of activity, it's very difficult for us to comment. Ajoy Chawla\", ' Yes, difficult. I mean anything which helps prevent or reduce illegal flows of gold in the country is most welcome is what I would say. Devanshu Bansal', ' Understood. And otherwise, Ajoy, generally are you seeing some rationality in competition from a making charge perspective, given that gold is now being hallmarked and certain (as we discuss) major routes of gold smuggling are also being closed by the government. So, any general otherwise are you seeing some rationality from a making charge pricing perspective? Ajoy Chawla', ' Not so much making charge. I think in quarter 2 the gold rate -- price wars on the gold rate was quite intense. That seems to have kind of stabilized in quarter 3. And perhaps further cut on illegal imports, etcetera, might help in keeping the gold rates stable. Making charges, I think it is pretty much what it was. Devanshu Bansal', ' Got it, sir. That’s it from my end. Thanks for taking my question.  Moderator', ' Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Videesha Sheth from Ambit Capital. Please go ahead. Videesha Sheth', ' Hi, I hope I am audible. Thank you for taking my question. The first one is on the studded -- sorry to harp on this again. But for Titan, the studded mix has been under pressure. I appreciate that it’s a base effect that’s playing out like gold price is driving this. But when we look at your closest peer, the studded mix has been stable for them. I understand that it might be difficult to comment on competition, but just wanted your thoughts on what could be driving this divergence. Ajoy Chawla', \" So, in Tanishq historically we have been lower on the market share in gold vis-a-vis being the leaders in market share in studded. And for most of the other traditional players who are there who have been largely gold focused. And therefore, for them the  \\nmarket share is lower in studded, whereas relatively the market share may be better off in gold.  I think these could be playing out. But we are well distributed across the country, North, West, etcetera, where studded plays a bigger role. So again, market mix could be playing a role. Very difficult to comment, but as far as we are concerned, we are very happy with the growth in both. And if gold is growing fast, which means we are gaining market share which is actually very good for us because it's playing out exactly the way we want it to play out.  So again, the absolute growth in individual segments is perhaps more important to see than seeing the share as a percentage, which is a win-loss in our calculation. Videesha Sheth\", ' Understood. That helps. And second was just two small questions on CaratLane. First one was just a clarification that do you stick to the potential guidance for CaratLane which was given out during your annual investor meet and how do you see the trajectory moving along? Management', ' Hi, we will just open Saumen’s line for answering it. Just a second. Hi Saumen Sir, you may please answer it. Saumen Bhaumik', \" Hi this is Saumen. I think last two quarters have been good. Last quarter in particular we had good revenue growth and that actually the single largest factor and we I think managed our overall cost quite well, despite the dilution in margin which is because of customs duty and gold rate increase. The impact of these two has certainly made our EBIT percentage a lot better. That is a bit of Q3 phenomena. It is not significantly different than previous year also. So overall the effort will be in that direction to keep EBIT percentage rise, but this is only one quarter. I think we'll look at quarter-by-quarter as it progresses. Videesha Sheth\", ' And the second is on CaratLane. Is it possible to share the catchment growth for 3Q or the 9 months given that SSG could be depressed due to higher store density? Saumen Bhaumik', \" I didn't get your question, please? Videesha Sheth\", ' Is it possible to share the catchment level growth for either third quarter or 9 months given that SSGs could be depressed due to the higher store density, the cluster level growth or the catchment growth? Saumen Bhaumik', ' Our overall growth in quarter 3 has been quite good. And I can give you some indication of our like-to-like store growth which is also very good, the 16% in quarter  \\n3 and previous quarter is 21% which is significantly higher than what happened in the previous four or five quarters. Videesha Sheth', ' No problem. I will circle back. Thank you. That’s all from my side. Moderator', ' Thank you. Ladies and Gentlemen, we request you to restrict to two questions per participant. The next question comes from the line of Sheela Rathi from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Sheela Rathi', \" Thanks for taking my question. So, my first question was you sounded very optimistic on the trends which we have seen this quarter. So, any callouts here in terms of geography-wise performance and Ajoy you also mentioned that buyer growth is important for us. So, what is the mix of new buyer and existing buyer growth?  And is there a diverging trend in studded and gold jewellery buying for a new buyer and existing buyer and is it fair to say that when you buy gold coins, it's generally the new buyer who is buying more of these gold coins because you also said that we had some very strong trends there. That was my first question? Ajoy Chawla\", \" Yes. So geographically for the quarter, South and East have grown faster than the national. North which was a little subdued in quarter 2 has bounced back very strongly for us. And West has been even, I would say, because there are some markets which have done very well and some markets are still a little subdued. So broadly that's the region wise split of growth. We are seeing Tier 2, Tier 3 towns do better than the top metros, but then that has also been a thrust for us over the last several years and so much expansion have happened across all these markets, but yes overall that is there, aspirations are high. In terms of new versus repeat for the quarter 3 that was -- that we declared results for, 48% new and 52% repeat. That's pretty much the pattern which was there even last year in quarter 3.  Typically, in festive quarters there is always a lot of new buyer activity because many more buyers enter the brand for us. Now gold coin is not necessarily a new buyer oriented (phenomena). I would say gold jewellery has been because that's where we want to gain share by going deeper into regions or by simply seeing so many people are already gold buyers. So, they -- it's easy for them to migrate to Tanishq from an unorganized space into gold first. Studded is something which happens later, but of late, if I were to look at the last 1 - 1.5 years, amongst a certain segment of customers, let's say, younger, modern, maybe more urban, top towns we are seeing enough new buyer growth even in studded, though largely under the sub ₹100,000 price band and segment.   \\nAnd this happens across Tanishq, CaratLane and Mia. And perhaps the many players which are there now in this new age space, new age competition I'll call them, which are mainly studded everyday wear, that is something which is emerging as well. So, in a way new buyer growth comes from both studded, but mostly in studded on the modern everyday wear jewellery and in gold it is more in the traditional space where we are gaining market share. I mean, broadly, that's way to look at it. Coins is something which is investment buyer. It could very well be an existing Tanishq buyer. There is no such pattern of new and repeat. Sheela Rathi\", \" Understood. And my second and final question is, I mean, Venkat made the point on how on a monthly basis the trend change on the pricing side and currency. I just want to understand how should we think about the competitive landscape? Is it a monthly affair, a quarterly affair, in terms of the trends which you see especially from the independent and regional jewellers or is it more like a regular phenomenon where you can see a trend and that doesn't change very quickly. And also, if you can just guide us on how the landscape has been especially in the recent quarter? Ajoy Chawla\", \" Competitive activity, yes, of course, I mean all of us know and you would also obviously have it in the back of your mind is a daily affair. I mean everyday things can change, but we review it. So operating teams review it weekly to see what's happening. It's fairly dynamic. I look at it monthly. And perhaps at Venkat's level and at the Board level it is a quarterly review. So, we tend to review it at certain periodicity.  It's difficult to answer whether it remains stable. It depends on so much activity. But as we see it right now at an aggregate level, I think the high levels of competitive intensity have been continuing for a while now, and we see that to continue. Okay. player A may get replaced by player B, player C may come in. Some new unorganized guy may suddenly become very active, or a new player may get launched in the market while an existing player may run into some trouble, etcetera. Those are just incidentals. We watch them, but frankly, we focus a lot more on the customer and see what we can try to win the customer. The competition is incidental. Moderator\", ' Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jay Doshi from Kotak. Jay Doshi', \" Hi. Thanks for the opportunity. My first question is on demand. You've had a good 25% growth for the past 2 quarters. Do you think that kind of growth rates can sustain for a few more quarters, especially because gold prices are up 25% - 30% Y-o-Y. That's my first question. Second is on this 11% to 11.5% EBIT margin guidance. Is it at a consolidated level for jewellery business or a stand-alone level?  \\nAnd third is, although you did mention about that your focus is on driving the absolute EBIT growth in the jewellery business given that gold price increases are much ahead of expectation, so you are overshooting on the growth plans versus what you had given guidance at your investor meet. But at the EBIT level, EBIT growth, what is that target in your mind that you sort of are internally sort of thinking? What's the right EBIT growth now that one assumes that margin seems to have settled or stabilized at a level? So those were my 3 questions. Thank you. C. K. Venkataraman\", \" I'll start answering the first question. Amidst all the consumption pressure -- private consumption pressure that we see all around company results what is getting covered a lot, if you were to sort of separate the upper middle class, the upper classes, and the really affluent versus the middle class and below in that, we see both, if you see sector performances, those of you who may have aggregated sectors and seen. That points to a marked difference in sector performance. Those which are catering to the upper middle class and above, like Titan company is, is performing better than typically mass-market volume kind of sectors. Why is that? If you look at the long-term trend, which is sort of visualized by FY30, so top 2 income segments are expected to grow from 13% share in, I think, FY21 to 26% share in FY26. So, it's a secular trend that is reported that will underscore the per capita GDP moving to the US$5,500. And the real concrete stuff relating to that is if you just see calendar 2024, there is a ₹75 lakh crore increase in the market cap in the country. I mean that's a hell of a lot of crores of -- lakhs of crores of market cap, which is obviously in the hands of a few crore people. And of course, FIIs and all that, but certainly a few crores of people, the wealth effect of those people is certainly one aspect. And if you look at, for example, the change in the number of income tax payers, below ₹5 lakhs between 2014 and 2024, it's about 2x, whereas the number of income tax payers from ₹5 lakh and above, it is 4.2x. So clearly, I mean, the inequality rising is one consequence of that. But clearly, from a consumption point of view, these classes of households are in a much better position. And the role of inflation, which is substantially staples, grocery, to some extent rent maybe, the role of those in the total income is low. So their incomes are rising very highly. The costs are not rising to that extent. And wealth has risen substantially. Therefore, both abilities to spend as well as the safety net the wealth effect provides. So, these are the reasons why companies like Titan continue to do well. And of course, on top of that, we have another advantage of being a strong jewellery industry company, and the price of gold is another reason for people to -- even people with less  \\nmoney -- to actually convert money into gold. So, these are the long answer, but these are the significant factors. Jay Doshi\", ' Thank you. Sorry if I may... Ajoy Chawla', ' And just weighing in on the gold -- you said gold price and this thing -- currently there is a fair amount of volatility on gold price. And therefore, during a very volatile period, consumers also kind of become a little cautious. But other than getting caught in the noise -- see, this year, quarter 1 was subdued. And we saw the bounce back in quarter 2 and then there was a Shraddha effect quarter 2, quarter 3, a lot of quarter-to-quarter volatility. My suggestion is look at the last 3 quarters consolidated level, and then you will probably get to a more normalized understanding. Similarly, even on studded, look at how Q2 plus Q3 played out, it gives you a better understanding of how things could play out, because very high growth rates may not be so easily sustainable, but rolling basis, it might be good. C. K. Venkataraman', ' The other thing I forgot to share; Titan is one of those few companies which has got an exceptional ‘tech touch’ aspect with respect to its customers. Our total customer database exceeds 4 crores today. And a very good part of these 4 crore customers are personally known to our staff, their milestone events in their lives, their purchase history, all that is known through our CRM system. Therefore, our ability to connect the customer with the right trigger at the right time is really benchmark level, which many other companies lack, and therefore we end up getting that share of wallet a little more easily than others may be able to. Jay Doshi', ' Sure. And sir, my question on margin? Ajoy Chawla', ' Yes, margin is on a standalone basis what we gave, 11% to 11.5%. Consol I am not giving. Moderator', ' The next question comes from the line of Amit Sachdeva from UBS Group. Amit Sachdeva', \" Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. A good set of numbers in jewellery. My question is, I mean, alluding to your conjecture on that, there's a price war of some sort which emerged in gold price. And given that context, I think 28% in secondary growth, and you know, 25% kind of jewellery growth seems very impressive. And so, congratulations for that. The next question is that is it -- if the market is now in new pricing equilibrium of some sort that you're comfortable growing in that context?  \\nOr incrementally as the gold price is very volatile, now this frontier of so-called price war can shift into making charges? Because as the gold price increases, somebody can obviously theoretically offer discounts on making charges and this results in another reaction and another reaction. So, I just want to understand, as we grow at the margin in the marketplace, the linked question is that do you feel comfortable with pricing equilibrium that exists between the organized players? And regional players which are sort of -- compete with you? That's question number one. Ajoy Chawla\", \" So, a tough one to answer. Our attempt is always to keep that premium between us and competition. It is not just unorganized. Even with organized players, we have a premium over them. And it's a perennial push. I think a lot of that has to do with what we do on the ground as well as the investments we do in the brand as an air cover. So, it's an ongoing thing. I don't think there is anything -- Amit, I don't know whether you can say there's stability in competitive intensity on pricing. I think it is an ever-increasing spree, and therefore our efforts are also in that direction to see what we can do between product mix, between better sourcing, between working on minimising gold loss, GC max, a lot of execution, which kind of helps us stay afloat, including even good strategies on hedging and spot buying versus gold metal loans. So, there are many variables at play, and that's what helps us to try and keep -- so our aim is to try and keep GC stable on a longer-term basis, but competitive intensity, there is nothing like stability, I would say. C. K. Venkataraman\", \" Just -- I don't know whether we would term it a price war. A very, very dynamic price situation, yes. And because of multiple types of competitors across the country, the complexity of that, apart from the daily fluctuation, has also risen. And therefore, our ability to remain agile, that has increased -- has to increase, even continue to be there. But it's not a war, because a war would mean you're actually fighting with somebody every day. I think it's the gold prices, because it is changing every day. Amit Sachdeva\", ' So, in that sense, can I ask for how the Q4 is evolving so far, and studded to gold, and could you comment on that a bit? And...? Ajoy Chawla', \" So, we started very well in the first few weeks of January, first 2 to 3 weeks. And then suddenly after many exciting developments in the international, especially US, has created a lot of excitement on gold price again and dollars. So, everything else is dynamic. I think there's a lot of noise right now. I mean it's actually very difficult to predict how Q4 will go because the next few weeks and how much is posturing, how much is real.  \\nThen the gold moved from London market to Comex because of anticipated tariffs, suddenly there was gold shortage in the market last 1 week. And gold metal loan price -- interest rates are also fluid. Banks themselves don't know what to do. So, this is a little bit of mice. Difficult to predict how this quarter will go. It started off well, then it kind of hovered somewhere. And right now, I think a lot of customers are also thinking, let's see where this gold price stabilizes. But if it doesn't come down at all, then people may think it's better to buy right now rather than wait. So difficult to predict. We hope that we are able to sustain some kind of growth rates that we have seen between -- cumulatively between all the quarters put together, or at least quarter 2 plus quarter 3, but slightly difficult to predict. But longer term, we are more confident. C. K. Venkataraman\", \" And what I would add, Amit, is that what the division has done in the last 4-5 months, particularly, to stay on top of the game in all parts of the business is what is actually also in delivering the kind of growth that we got in quarter 3. And therefore, from a customer value point of view as well as a competitive point of view, to the extent we need to compete like that, I think we are in a very good place. What Ajoy is talking about is completely outside our control, outside anybody's control, frankly, of an external situation, which is early days and it's playing out with so much intensity because it's just a week, 10 days into that situation. I think in other 10 days, 2 weeks, a lot of dialogues are going on across the world between various people. I'm sure all that will settle. And the intrinsic competitive advantage of the brand and the division will start extracting the natural value that we deserve. Amit Sachdeva\", \" Got it. Thanks so much for taking this. My second and my last question is basically -- is a business model question. Given so many moving parts are there, studded mix, diamond pricing, customers' willingness to pay diamond, to gold price volatility and competitiveness, all forces are sort of coinciding at the same point. But the question then is that as you look to maximize revenue growth and keeping the margin in a respectable zone, which is now 11% to 11.5%. My question is, would you have sort of threshold margin that, at a business model level, we will not go below, say, 10%, and that's the margin is the lowest for us and we design the economics around that? Or is it something that threshold doesn't exist and you will maximize it. But how one should think about what could be floor of that strategy and what could be the cap on that strategy? Ajoy Chawla\", \" Yes. So okay, I'll take that one. So, first of all, we don't look at margin at the quarter level. We look at annualized because of the seasonality shifts, etcetera. And frankly,  \\nin my mind, at least, to me, 11% is a little bit of a threshold that is going below 11% would not feel right to me, unless it's a very extreme situation, what we had during COVID or something, totally wild and unpredictable. But by and large, not going below 11% on an annualized basis is for sure my threshold. I don't know how much leeway the Board or Venkat will give me. Amit Sachdeva\", ' Got it. Fair enough. That’s very helpful. Thanks a lot. Moderator', ' Ladies and Gentlemen, in interest of time and fairness to others, we request you to restrict to one question per participant and rejoin the question queue. The next question comes from the line of Tejas Shah from Avendus Park Institutional Equities. Tejas Shah', \" Hi Good morning. Thanks for opportunity. Couple of questions on jewellery. So, in our channels, we are seeing that a new competitor is securing good locations near our stores. Now our store performance in this area is in line with division's average or weaker. And I just wanted to check, Ajoy, on your previous comment?  Have we tested removing our gold price premium? And wherever we would have done that, does our consumer or customer recruitment actually goes much higher than the average? Ajoy Chawla\", \" So, I'll answer the second question first. Yes, whenever we have brought down the premium on our gold prices vis-a-vis our, let's say, most relevant competitor in the market, we have seen customer acquisition becomes much easier. Takes out 1 question out of the equation.  And we've seen that in certain regional markets. We've seen that in certain other markets wherever we've done that. And in a way, over a period of time we have rationalized gold rate markup premiums in the last 5 years. It has been a sustained year-to-year effort and quarter-to-quarter effort, and we've migrated those towards either making charges or product mix.  The first one, wherever a new competitor has come and has opened a store next to us, it's difficult. There are pluses and minuses. There are gains and losses. What we do is we also have a pre-emptive strategy, the competitive strategy, in which we know when the competitor is opening, and therefore we go out of the way to strengthen our product mix.  We do a lot of work on repeat customers. We up the presence and amp up the visibility of the store in that market. And by and large, we feel that we've been able to blunt that. But there are stores which might be, let's say, intrinsically needing a bigger location  \\nor, let's say, the operational effectiveness of the store has been a little question mark. In those markets, in that particular store, we do see an impact.  But by and large, we've been able to actually grow well, better than what we would have grown, whenever we put in the right investments and proactive approach. That's been our approach and that's a separate part of our on-ground competitive strategy. C. K. Venkataraman\", ' The other aspect we need to keep in mind is not all the players in the jewellery sector are competitors to us. There are many in the news, not all are competitors. We know who our competitors are because the customer conversations, the customer value proposition, all that tell us that, and we keep an eye on them, not an eye on everybody. Tejas Shah', \" Got it. And second and last, one source of volatility coming from Trump tariff is also that we picked up from media news item that gold lease can actually get impacted globally. So, any early read through there? I know it's volatile, but any read through there? Ajoy Chawla\", ' Vijay, you can answer. Vijay Govindrajan', \" Yes. So, one of the things that we are seeing is in the last 1-month phenomena is a slight increase in the gold on lease rates indicated by the banks. But again, there is also a supply situation that they are also trying to address. So, we need to see, therefore, over the next few months how the supply situation of gold plays out and, in that context, how these rates finally stabilize.  But definitely the initial indications are that the gold on lease rates could go up. It's just that we need to wait for a month or two to understand how the supply, and therefore the pricing, will play out. Ajoy Chawla\", ' And just to add on to that, even if they do play out, we have other levers on hand to kind of manage it between spot, and we are also operating through GIFT City, and many other levers are there for us to kind of manage that mix between gold on lease and spot, and exchange, of course, continues to be a very strong driver for us. Tejas Shah', ' Got it. Clear and all the best for the coming quarters. Moderator', ' The next question comes from the line of Kunal Vora from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Kunal Vora', ' Are you seeing any impact of the LGD stores which are coming up? I know on a national level there will not be any impact. But like in specific locations, for example, Borivali, I see that there are 8, 10 stores, LGD selling within kilometers from Tanishq  \\nand CaratLane. So, are you seeing any impact on those stores in terms of studded business of Tanishq or on the sales of CaratLane? Ajoy Chawla', ' See, one way for -- the way I look at it is I see it as a portfolio play between Tanishq, CaratLane, Mia and the rest of the market. And as far as we are concerned, we are seeing fairly good buyer growth continue in studded in the sub-100,000 segment, which is where most of the LGD players are playing.  So as of now, we have not yet seen that impact. But in specific markets like Borivali, I\\'m not able to answer right now whether in Borivali market we are seeing some impact, because I\\'ll have to see a portfolio play for Borivali market for all our brands, because we\\'ve also expanded with a multiple portfolio play.  But so far, even the spot checks that we do at Mia store, CaratLane store and Tanishq store, customers at least have not commented, \"Why are you not keeping LGD?\" Many of them continue to say, I hope your diamonds are all natural, and by any chance do you have LGD, or it is only natural?  There\\'s more clarificatory questions that we are getting. But you\\'re right, we can\\'t be sure how these things play out. So, thanks for sharing this sharper question. We will -- I will identify certain markets and keep a close track on it. Kunal Vora', ' And second quick one on the new income tax change, there will be higher disposable income, and it also looks like more people will be willing to disclose slightly higher income, maybe instead of 7,8 lakhs, like 12 lakhs. Do you see this benefiting the organized jewellery? Do you think showing PAN card has been an issue for certain customers? C. K. Venkataraman', \" I think it will benefit the whole consumption sector, not just the jewellery sector. Of course, we will get our due share of that. It is certainly a welcome move from multiple angles. And I'm sure our confidence in the FY '26 growth got another additional boost four days back. Ajoy Chawla\", \" And PAN card, who don't want to show PAN card are really the very, very rich. I'm not sure how this plays out. But I hope what Venkat said is benefiting us. Kunal Vora\", ' Understood. And like many would not be having much of reported income. So at least the reporting level also could go up from the business class? C. K. Venkataraman', ' They are betting on that, but even the ₹1 lakh crores becoming ₹2 lakh crores in total because the multiplier and all should flow. The due share should flow to us. Moderator', ' The next question comes from the line of Harit Kapoor from Investec.  \\nHarit Kapoor', \" I just have two quick ones. One was on -- so if you look at all your format performances this quarter, so it's probably the first quarter in 7, 8 quarters where everything in terms of sales value growth has been in double digit, and even the 7, 8 quarters back had a low-ish kind of COVID base?  Apart from your internal initiatives that you've articulated on this call, I mean, do you believe that this -- the segment price points that you're operating at in jewellery, and even some of the mid-premium, etcetera, on Analog watches?  There is demand trends have -- I won't say inelastic, but they have been significantly more stable and likely to continue to be so as compared to a lot of other consumption spaces? Because this dichotomy of double-digit growth across your formats is something that you're not seeing in most other consumption spaces? C. K. Venkataraman\", \" Very much so. So, the one big thing is this segment of sort of premium to the inflation, low wage growth, maybe even job losses and all that. And that's in our favour. That's the first.  The second is, in multiple categories we have low market share. And the formalization acceleration is to our advantage, which many other companies across sectors may not have.  The third is overall strategy as well as execution has improved, particularly in some of the new businesses. And you saw a Ambuj clarification about Taneira that was reported actually hides a rather better picture on the ground in terms of offtake.  And even internationally, I mean we didn't speak at all to the question, but if you look at the international growth, it's exceptional in GCC and North America, so I think it's a combination of segments which are in our favour, and the growing in income as well as the numbers, the market share opportunity continues to be strong for virtually all our categories.  The assets on the ground, because we are a unique company with more than -- our 90% of our sales is EBF. That's a very rare situation and a very strong brand, very strong partners. We have 1,000 partners across the length and breadth of the country. No company can boast of 1,000 people with fire in their belly as well as in their hearts, and actually driving the performance of the company that we all boast.  That is -- we can't even gauge the power of that, right? And of course, the ‘touch tech’ things that I spoke of, the customer relationship, knowledge. Therefore, certainly we see a long runway on this thing.  \\nHarit Kapoor\", ' Second was CaratLane. On last 2 quarters, on a Y-o-Y basis, the margin expansion has been very strong. Would you attribute this largely to strong same-store sales growth, strong like-for-like growth which has come back, which is driving operating leverage? Or what are the other factors kind of play into this? C. K. Venkataraman', ' Yes. Saumen, you can now answer. Saumen Bhaumik', ' Last 2 quarters, I think we tried a lot more on the sales growth, and there are very many things that we did in the space of product newness as well as some tweak in the way we reach out to customers and talk about the marketing media mix, but little experiments that we have done. All that has worked in our favour when it comes to the revenue.  On the other hand, we also kind of looked back at productivity, and we kind of managed our multiple elements of cost quite well. I think these are the 2 things that I would say the key factors that has expanded our performance in terms of profitability, profit margin and so on and so forth. Moderator', ' The next question comes from the line of Vivek Maheshwari from Jefferies. Vivek Maheshwari', \" Just one question. When -- you mentioned about diamond prices being stable, but when we talk to industry players, my understanding, and correct me if I'm wrong, but through the course of the last yar and second half of this quarter, the diamond prices actually continued to slide down. Is that understanding not correct? Ajoy Chawla\", \" I think the players we are speaking of are talking about wholesale prices in dollars, and largely for the U.S. market and big stones. Mostly, they are all big stones. So, when it comes to small stones, which is, by the way, the bulk of our studded jewellery, there is a very different outlook and reality.  The other piece here is, as far as we are concerned, any efficiencies in buying at reasonable prices, etcetera, helps us. But from a retail price point of view for what we are selling to the market, it has been stable.  So, a lot of that gets covered in narratives and by diamond players and many other things they're talking about, they're really talking about their selling prices of the rough, and -- or -- sorry, they're buying prices are rough and they're selling prices of big stones at wholesale level for international and domestic markets.  And the things they quote Rappaport, Rapnet, etcetera, frankly, the reality is at the price you buy from them versus -- and the price you set in the market. So, it is from that context I was saying as far as we are concerned, we are seeing fairly stable prices in diamonds.  \\nVivek Maheshwari\", \" Got it. And just a follow-up. So when you talk about in the last few years you have taken efforts to, let's say, bring some level of clarity with the -- on the gold side, in case of diamond, is there a micro market need to also look at, because there aren't that many players in the market on the diamond side?  So how do you ensure that you are competitive? Or, given that you are, like your -- you face very little competition, you in a way determine the price of the jewellery, the studded jewellery? Ajoy Chawla\", \" No. Nothing like we determine the price. Market is full of players, there are enough players today in the market, new age as well as existing traditional players who are doing strong work on studded.  All I would say is I think our focus has been on continuing to build brand desire for Tanishq diamonds and newness of designs and all the things that Venkat spoke about, just in the preceding answer. So really, it's a question of maintaining an edge on product and brand superiority and customer experience that really helps us. Vivek Maheshwari\", ' Got it. And last bit on this one only. So, Sir, is -- so with a particular piece of studded jewellery, will it -- the price will be the same across the country, or it can change based on the micro market and the competition in that market? Ajoy Chawla', \" No. It's the same across the country. Moderator\", ' Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraint, we take that as the last question, and we conclude the question-and-answer session. I now hand the conference over to Mr. Ajoy Chawla, CEO of Jewellery, for his closing comments. Ajoy Chawla', \" Yes. On behalf of Venkat, who had to step out for an urgent call, I would like to thank all of you for all the challenging and exciting questions that you'll keep asking us. Until we see you next time, bye. Moderator\", ' Thank you. On behalf of Titan Company Limited, that concludes this conference. Thank you for joining us, and you may now disconnect your lines. ']\n",

      "['\\nModerator', \"  Ladies and gentlemen, good day and welcome to Titan Company Limited's Q4 & FY'25 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, all participant lines will be in the listen-only mode and there will be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes. Should you need assistance during the conference call, please signal an operator by pressing * then 0 on your touchtone phone. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I now hand over the conference over to Mr. C. K. Venkataraman – Managing Director, Titan Company Limited. Thank you and over to you, sir. C. K. Venkataraman\", \" Thank you very much. Good evening, everyone. It's wonderful to meet at the end of a wonderful quarter. Performance very satisfying across segments, across countries. And clearly, when despite the surround being challenging, whether it is gold rate on the one side or pressures on discretionary consumption, I think the innovation engines of Titan Company, execution excellence on all fronts, assets in the air, on the ground, partners of exceptional caliber, deep and wide across the world now, and the tens of thousands of what we broadly call Titanians putting their heart and soul into everything that they do has delivered a very good performance, very satisfying and over to you for the questions. Moderator\", ' Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. First question is from the line of Manoj Menon from ICICI Securities. Please go ahead. Manoj Menon', \" Hi. first of all, good luck to Venkat for all the future endeavors and good luck to Ajoy as you take on the new role. Good luck and God bless to both. Couple of questions from my side on the jewellery business. One, given the incessant sort of price increase which you have seen in the gold commodity, just some snippets from you in terms of your research as well as anecdotal evidence on what the consumer telling you, right? So is the consumer cutting back on the volume side of it, is the consumer asking for more 18 carat? And more importantly, how do you see this evolving and what are the plans in place? That's the first one. Ajoy Chawla\", \" Thanks, Manoj. Just reminding you that this is effective 1st Jan. So we have still way to go. But, thanks for your good wishes. And answering your question on what the consumer is saying, so 2-3 things are coming out and I am seeing this now for the last several months. As gold prices have kind of clipped up so sharply, we are seeing in the sub ₹50,000 price band, very specifically, more in gold and little bit in studded also, there is an impact on the consumer sentiment there. Now some of it is us vacating price points because simply gold price goes up, the same product goes into a certain higher price band. That is one part of the story. But there is  \\ncontinued, let's say customer sentiment in that lower price band where we are seeing some buyer being a little reticent. Second piece is yes, customers are more open to 18 carat gold, though we don't really have the full information as yet. We have just launched some collections in 18 carat gold in certain parts of the country for traditional customers as well and we hope that we will see good response. And I know that in CaratLane, we have launched something in 9 carats as well. So there is early traction and I think more and more customers are going to be open to lower caratage simply because the price point has become quite a bit. On the higher price bands, while there is buyer growth, we are seeing some of the customers actually scaling down the complexity of product they are willing to buy. So it means that if earlier they were open to buying a higher making charge product, they are sliding down a bit, but they are still buying a certain quantum of gold and a certain value. So there is some indications there. And if I were to answer your question on what are customers telling us in terms of our conversation, they certainly are feeling the pinch and therefore they are looking for solutions both on terms of lightweight jewellery, lower caratage jewellery as well as probably lower making charge jewellery. So, you know, they still want gold but they're looking at how they can manage it within their budgets. Manoj Menon\", \" Understood. Thank you, Ajoy. Just one quick follow up and then I will have a second question. So the quick follow up here is if let's say in a hypothetical scenario because end of the day gold is just a commodity, if gold corrects 20%-30% and probably stays there, I know that it may not last for long. I am not taking a commodity view here. In the interim consumers may have moved from 22 (carat) to 18 (carat). Does it have some sort of, let's say an impact on your medium term, absolute revenue situation? Ajoy Chawla\", \" Actually, we would welcome any gold price correction because a lot more customers will come in the market. Evidence of that was seen when the Finance Minister had reduced their duties last year and so many fence seaters kind of just jumped in. So it's the best situation to be in. It also helps us improve margins actually on various fronts. So actually we would welcome it and any value or ticket size drop being compensated by a jump in number of buyers is a fabulous situation to be in because we can cultivate them. Manoj Menon\", \" That is fair one, sir. And quickly on the second one. As I understand the diamond prices, let's say in the wholesale market has declined materially over the last few years, whereas in the retail market, it is probably flat. Now I am thinking from a consumer point of view who let's say bought diamond from any jeweler 2-3 or 4 years back with an explicit or implicit understanding that I can actually come and exchange it at the market price. Now, is there a situation where consumers are coming and looking for an exchange and realizing that my diamond prices are not inflated at all, where gold and does that have any implication for let's say what he or she is buying today in an exchange? Is he preferring more gold over studded or diamonds rather? Ajoy Chawla\", \" So one clarification that there are different behaviors in the Solitaire segment and specially the bigger sizes, 1 carat, 2 carat plus and then smaller carat sizes in Solitaire and then the small. More than 90-95% of studded business is non-Solitaire which means they are small. Have the  \\nprices really come down in wholesale market or in retail? No. In Solitaire, there's a different story. One carat plus, two carat plus in the wholesale, they have come down. But if I were to go back five years ago, somebody has bought vis-à-vis 5 years ago, the price has not really, I mean, it went up and it's come down. So the index, it's really difficult to kind of mathematically conclude it because it's to do with the type of diamond - fancy shaped, big, small spec, VVS, there are simply too many elements, but I am just giving an index feel to it. So this is at the wholesale level also and in retail certainly anybody who's bought diamonds from us from five years back is not going to experience a drop. They may say okay it's not really appreciated much. But somebody who's bought it 2 years back may think that the price has come down but actually that is more narrative in the media that he might be reading whereas when she comes to the store she may say there may be a 5%-6% impact. But coming to the question you asked because of this, let's say narrative or otherwise, if this perception exists are people saying let me go to gold, there is a bunch of people who are saying especially the high carat Solitaire buyer and there's a very small number by the way in the entire year that we sell to them. That customer has become a little wary of using the Solitaire big stone as a means of investment and therefore because the price volatility thing let's see where this settles and let's see if it starts firming up. So they are holding back. Are these guys going and buying gold? Some of them may be doing so. I don't have exact data to correlate. But we do know that some of our high lifetime value customers are all feeling gold is certainly the flavor at this point in time. And they have no hesitation in buying gold, whereas they may have some hesitation in buying the Solitaire. On Studded, small stones, I don't think this story is at all playing out the way we might be imagining. And that is more than 90% of the studded. So different stories sitting here and different kinds of segments and very, we are also leveraging that. And by the way, on the Solitaire side, smaller stone sizes, we are seeing a whopping increase in buyers. And at overall level, studded buyers is outpacing gold buyers, whether Solitaire or otherwise. Not now, but the last two quarters and it carries on into this month. April month also it has been that way. So actually, at a buyer level the story is different from the value level that we are seeing. I don't know if I answered you or confused you but I am just giving you 3-4 different insights. Manoj Menon\", ' And I will have to listen to the transcript once again, sir. Thank you and good luck. Moderator', ' Thank you. The next question is from the line of Avi from Macquarie. Please go ahead. Avi Macquarie', ' Hi Yes, I just wanted to spend some time on the jewellery margin. Could you please help clarify this overhead management which you carried out this quarter and how sustainable are these gains? Essentially, the context is that despite a weakening mix, you have seen almost 12% standalone EBITDA margin and hence is there an upside possibility to that 11% to 11.5% range that you were indicating in prior to this quarter? Ashok Sonthalia', \" Avi, Ashok here. Actually 11.9% if you think about domestic jewellery business, it's kind of 11.6%. You can see in our disclosure that there has been higher primary for international  \\nbusiness and they had some positive impact on the reported number. But 11.6% nevertheless had element of, small element of operating leverage as well as some hedging gains sitting it. Whenever robust growth happens, some element of operating leverage coming in the jewellery business is quite normal and which has happened. So it is not that extraordinary effort to squeeze out the normal cost which we need to invest for the growth of the jewellery business. It is just the scale going up for last 2-3 quarters has given that benefit. Of course, we have been mindful of what cost we are incurring and how we are incurring but it is combination of operating leverage as well as some hedging gain which you are seeing that studded ratio is slightly lower but still we are able to deliver. As far as coming to 11% to 11.5% margin guidance, I think that stays. We are not guiding you for any upside. Considering the uncertainty of gold prices and many, many uncertainties for future, 11% to 11.5% seems to be more reasonable to think about. Avi Macquarie\", \" Got it, Sir. Fairly clear. Sir, and the second and last bit is on the demand side. Now, you did clearly allude towards the consumer behavior asking for more value, more making charge, and we have been able to deliver that in this quarter as well, it seems like. Now if I were to kind of look at this going forward for FY'26, how would you parse the growth? Are you in a scenario where the last year is giving you confidence of upwards of 15%, if you could give some sense on how should we look at the next year? That's all from my side. Ajoy Chawla\", ' Sorry, what is 15%? Avi Macquarie', \" I mean, sales growth, sorry, jewellery sales growth. If you were to look at your earlier mid-year targets and what kind of is expected for the next few years on a simple average basis, it does imply the upwards of 15% to reach that 2.2x-2.5x. And that's the context where I was coming from. Ajoy Chawla\", \" That's the derived figure. Okay. So I think demand outlook has been driven especially in this last quarter and even to an extent in Quarter 3 by the average ticket size growth which has certainly been influenced by the increase in gold prices and therefore buyer sentiment and buyer growths have been rather muted. Now how this will play out as we go forward very difficult, but certainly from our end we continue to target high double-digit growths, whether it comes in value, whether it comes out of buyer or ticket size or a combination of the two that is a very quarter-to-quarter fluctuating scenario, very difficult to predict. But certainly, we are targeting and we are preparing and aiming for these high double-digit growths. What turns out, of course, depends on the situation. Avi Macquarie\", ' But, do you see international at risk because of this tariff talk, etc. or is that not anything to get so much to be bothered about? Ajoy Chawla', ' Diny will try and answer that for you.  \\nKuruvilla Markose', \" Hi, this is Diny here. Tariffs, as of the way we are seeing things now in both in the US market, it's not really cost any significant thing, but that we have not taken any price increases as yet. We're waiting. We will watch how the whole situation unfolds and then basis that depending on what competition also does, it's quite likely that if tariffs go up, then we will take price increases. How that's going to play out? Will it mute demand? At this point in time, the view would be that it doesn't look likely. And it also looks like between India and the U.S. the bilateral trade agreement is progressing well and it looks that we will reach some kind of an agreement on that. Trump has just announced that he struck a deal with UK first and since India has already done a similar deal with UK, India and the US doing a deal looks quite likely. Avi Macquarie\", ' Got it, fairly clear. I will come back in the queue for the other questions. Thank you. Moderator', ' Thank you. The next question is from the line of Videesha Sheth from Ambit Capital. Please go ahead. Videesha Sheth', ' Hi, good evening team. Thank you for the opportunity and congrats on numbers. My first question was on the competitive landscape. Last quarter you had mentioned that the element or the competition element on the gold pricing had stabilized, but on making charges it was still elevated. So given the increase that we have seen in the fourth quarter, can you comment on how the landscape has changed? That was my first question. Ajoy Chawla', ' I think it is broadly in the same zone as what I said last year. Competitive intensity continues to be very high. Price warriors are there. On gold rates, we have not seen that much activity. Making charge continues to fluctuate but by and large I would say remains what I said last time. Videesha Sheth', ' Got it. And the second question was on the studded jewellery part of things. As a category leader, how would you think about reviving consumption in this segment going forward? While the De Beers  partnership is a step in that direction, but any other, have you identified any additional initiatives on this front that could stimulate demand? Ajoy Chawla', \" Actually on studded, as I said, there are 2-3 segments. You think of it was Solitaire, within that there is lower sizes and bigger sizes. Lower sizes the demand has already revived and we have in fact aggressively pushed forward using our distribution network as well as our ability to source and supply. So that we are seeing very good growth. So that's been one lever. We have pivoted in a way from larger carat sizes to smaller ones. And it's showing up in numbers very well. In terms of jewellery, studded jewellery, if I think of our portfolio across Tanishq, CaratLane, Mia, and if you were to look at it in the sub ₹50,000, sub ₹1 lakh range, I think we have still been able to clock in maybe early double-digit growth in that area. Thanks to the portfolio play. And therefore pushing that portfolio play, including network expansion across CaratLane, Mia, and distribution depth, even in the Tanishq stores, I think that is the second lever. Third lever that we are really looking at is reducing the price points for customers by looking at lower caratage. So if people have been used to buying 18 carat studded, they're also now beginning to get  \\ncomfortable with 14 (carat) and in case of CaratLane they have also introduced 9 carat. So these are 3-4 different levers, but nevertheless desire creation and excitement by each brand continues to be at the heart of it all because finally it's an adornment product and she's wearing it to experience an emotion. So I think that continues to be a very big lever. Videesha Sheth\", \" Understood. That was helpful. Just a small follow up to this on the CaratLane and you launching the 9 carat, I mean jewellery under 9 carat as well. But given it's not hallmarked in nature, how do you expect consumers to react? Saumen Bhaumik\", ' Hi, this is Saumen. We launched this 9-carat jewellery sometime around valentine and we saw good response. This is not hallmarked. We are not claiming it is hallmarked. But it is stated as 9 carat diamond jewellery, it is sold as 9 carat diamond jewellery. But it is also quite likely that 9 carat is going to come under hallmarking very soon. It is in advanced stage. So I think that will settle down very soon. Otherwise we saw a decent response and if the gold rate increase, I think it is an alternate option for customer who are also looking an adornment other than just an investment. Videesha Sheth', ' Got it. Understood. Thank you. Moderator', ' Thank you. The next question is from the line of Arnab Mitra from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Arnab Mitra', ' Hi, team, and congratulations on a great performance across all the businesses. My question, again was on studded. And where I am coming from is when you anecdotally speak to a lot of people who historically have owned diamonds, they are from rich families, that segment seems to almost suggest anecdotally that we are not going to buy diamond or they are going to buy much lesser of diamonds going ahead. But your growth rates, buyer growths are all very good. So are we like dealing with completely different sets of consumers here? Are you getting the growth from people who are buying diamond for the first time in your view? Just trying to understand this disconnect that, a lot of people feel between when you speak to anecdotally and versus actual numbers, which shows good growth for you. Ajoy Chawla', \" Yes, actually there are many segments and frankly some of us anecdotally speak to only some other people like us and they may be all, already diamond buyers and fairly well off and very evolved diamond buyers. And again, if you happen to be speaking to the type who's seeking Solitaire as an investment buy, then that's another sub-segment within them. So I would say that there are simply too many different segments and the segment whom you are referring to, the ones who buy diamonds for investment is a rather small percentage of the total studded buyers existing or even if I think of the penetration of, I mean amongst new of course, new studded buyers, there's a vast ocean out there. So I am not even saying, certainly there are new people coming in, but even existing studded segment, this is a rather small percentage of people that we may be anecdotally receiving such pieces of information from. And even they might be  \\nfluctuating in their behavior. When it comes to adornment, they may have no qualms in buying smaller stones etc. And when it comes to investment they may be having a different point of view. Arnab Mitra\", \" Right. So from the data that you gave which is buyer growth being pretty strong that the fact that the value growth is not keeping up is purely a function of the fact that gold is a smaller component of the jewellery and therefore the unit price hasn't gone up as much as gold. Ajoy Chawla\", \" No, buyer growth is higher in studded than gold. But gold has been rather, rather dull because of the sub ₹50,000 segment. Okay, now that's the only piece here. At the high value end, is there a customer for studded jewellery? Certainly. Value growth will come. It's a mix of both, I don't think, I cannot conclude that growth will come only in the lower end in studded and higher end in gold, nothing like that. There is opportunity in both, in fact India is premiumizing and there are lot more Indians who are happy to spend on high value studded as well. So, this is not a commentary of this piece at all. There is opportunity in both. I was just making the point even in the sub one lakh studded we are seeing, because of portfolio pla,y we are seeing an early double-digit growth which is not a commentary on what is happening on the higher value studded. Arnab Mitra\", ' Got it. And my last question was just on this, we had obviously a lot of news around (gold) lease costs going out, going up during the quarter due to tariff speculation. So has it impacted the quarter in any way for you? And is there any lingering impact going forward on that? That would be my last question. Ashok Sonthalia', \" Of course, you are right that as a knee jerk reaction, gold on lease rate (GOL) has gone up almost doubled and more than doubled and it is settling down now. But more than that even gold price, you know, gold rate also impact our financing cost because now the same quantity of GOL is far more expensive 30%-40% and I have to pay interest on that 30%-40%. So just the rate increase had a small impact, but overall gold price increase has a larger impact for the full year as far as GOL interest cost is concerned. But the good news is that after that GOL rates have been settling down and I think they are now about 75-80 basis points above the historical number and we will see how does they play out in FY'26. Arnab Mitra\", \" Okay, thanks so much. That's it from my side. All the best. Moderator\", ' Thank you. The next question is from the line of Kunal Vora from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Kunal Vora', ' Yes, just one question. I hear from the market that wholesale price of LGD have again crashed in recent months. What are you picking up about the state of LGD retailers and is LGD coming up in your conversations also, if you can update us on your latest views on entering the LGD space?  \\nAjoy Chawla', ' So, I can share with you what I have picked up about the retail and wholesale prices of LGD. Most certainly the wholesale price was anyway coming down continuously and it continues to drop. And I think that will not stop because even automation will happen and many other tech developments and productivity developments will push costs down like any tech product. But interestingly, even on the retail side, many of the players were retailing LGD products at roughly ₹60,000 to ₹50,000 a carat. Now, this is to be taken with a pinch of salt because the caratage is not exactly straightforward. That has now come down to ₹30,000 for many players, barring 1 or 2 players who are continuing to retail it at ₹60,000. And there are new players coming in all the time. So our estimate is that the market will continue to drop the retail price of LGD per carat and that will make it much, more affordable. And I am not sure how the unit economics is going to play out for a bunch of these players. Unless, we see a large number of totally new buyers coming in to studded, which of course, if it happens, great news for the industry overall. So it is a choppy situation. But nevertheless, even at ₹30,000 a carat retail price, the markups are quite healthy. So, I suspect there will be more price warriors who may come. But this is just to give you an overall narrative and where this will end, very difficult to predict. Kunal Vora', ' And what about your thoughts on entering this phase? The drop in prices, does it make it completely unviable or would you give it a thought at some stage? Ajoy Chawla', \" We will keep thinking about it, is the best I can say because the stability has not been reached and it's not that everybody is coming and asking for LGDs etc. and many players are jumping in anyway so I think it's too premature to comment. Kunal Vora\", \" Okay. Thanks that's it from me. Moderator\", ' Thank you. The next question is from the line of Percy Panthaki from IIFL Securities. Please go ahead. Percy Panthaki', \" Hi Sir. I just wanted some clarity on this hedging gain. So my understanding was the purpose that we hedge is that the EBIT margins of the business remain unaffected by any volatility in the gold price. But you're saying that the reason why margins are higher is because of some hedging gains. And the second question related to this is that when the gold price is going up, we should actually have a hedging loss because we are recovering higher from the consumer and to offset that inventory gain, actually we are entering into a future contract. So that contract should give us a hedging loss. So can you just address these two issues, gaps in my understanding, please? Ashok Sonthalia\", \" Gold is volatile at this point of time and we have, if I can use the word contango gain, when you are doing forwards in gold thing, when you do the future, there is a different economics. When you do the forwards with the gold on international exchanges, then there is a different economics. And we have been able to do some of that transactions in Quarter 4, which gives us contango gain. And that is what the reason is. And it's not so, because every time it keeps moving and there are thousands of transactions which get squared up on everyday basis from our side, so  \\noverall basis when I compare that we have a small hedging gain. We are not and your idea is correct when we move from cash flow to fair value if you remember idea is to not disturb P&L through hedging actions but we have contango gains because we are able to do forward transaction on international exchange. Percy Panthaki\", ' Understood, sir. Sir, this contango gain is a one-time permanent gain or will it reverse next quarter? Ashok Sonthalia', ' No, so there is a part which is a timing wise, the period of forward will kind of keep accruing and then there could be a part which can reverse also depending on the gold price. Percy Panthaki', ' Okay, so part permanent and part phasing, is that how I should take it? Ashok Sonthalia', ' Yes. Percy Panthaki', \" Understood. Sir, second question is on the outlook for jewellery growth next year. So see, while the gold price inflation has definitely dampened the buying sentiment, number of buyers are coming lower etc., but still there is some amount of inflation which is sort of at least partially benefiting us because the gold price has, let's say, doubled in the last 3 to 4 years almost. So the person will not cut down his volume by half. He might cut down his volume, there is still a net-net gain in the overall outlay per customer. And that has benefited and you have done close to about 25% kind of topline growth this quarter. So my question is that if we assume that the gold price remains where it is currently, then should we expect this 25% kind of topline growth to continue for the next 2 to 4 quarters? Ajoy Chawla\", \" So Percy, this is Ajoy here. The 23% or 24% growth that you talked about, I am not sure it's 25%, maybe domestic, primary sales growth reported NSV is showing up as 23 point something percent. But that percentage is because there was also some amount of up stocking that happened in the year end because of an early Akshay Tritiya here, right? So, if I go down to the secondary growth actually the retail growth, it is around 20%. So I just wanted to correct you there. Certainly, what you said is true. When gold prices are going up sequentially there is a benefit there is a value growth and therefore there's a ticket size growth that we see. And in our mind, as I mentioned in an earlier question, we are certainly planning and targeting and also hoping for a healthy double-digit growth, either driven by ticket size or by buyer or by both. So the outlook for jewellery continues to be positive. If I may pick up 1 or 2 other threads, while we  have spoken a little bit about the headwinds on price of gold. See this year there is a very good wedding season in Quarter 1. Last year there wer elections in Quarter 1 and there were no wedding dates. Infrastructure spending by government has continued and will continue for the first 4-5 months, which was not there last year. There is also the largesse from the finance ministry on the IT for a large number of people in the country. Maybe not directly, but at least the secondary and tertiary, second order, third order benefits of that will start flowing into the economy. There is also lot of liquidity being injected, so a lot of positive tailwinds are there  \\ndespite the uncertainties that exist in the market. So our outlook for jewellery not just for the year but for the next few years continues to be bullish and we are committed to driving healthy double digit growth year-on-year. Percy Panthaki\", ' Got it Sir. If I might just push this a little bit, can we say that the growth rate trajectory has possibly, at least in the next couple of years, moved up from a high teens to slightly higher than 20%? Ajoy Chawla', \" I can't say that because that would be getting ahead of myself. We happen to have delivered a 20% growth in one quarter. We have to be a little bit more careful in making those statements. I would still say it is healthy double-digit growth whether it is going to be 15% or 20% or something in between the two, we would still leave it at that, between 15% to 20% is a fairly good rate I would say. Percy Panthaki\", \" Okay, Sir. That's very helpful. Thanks a lot and all the best. Moderator\", ' Thank you. The next question is from the line of Vishal Gutka from ASK Investment Managers. Please go ahead. Vishal Gutka', ' Hi team, congrats on the good side of numbers. Sir, I have one question on the franchisee format. My channel checks are suggesting that that you are piloting a format where capital is provided by franchisee and you will be running the store. I think peer Kalyan runs similar kind of store. Is this true and if it is true then historically capital has never been a challenge for us. Just wanted to get your comments on this. Ajoy Chawla', \" So, we have an exclusive format. One is of course we are always learning because we respect competition and what they do and there is obviously something to learn from them. So we study what they are doing and what a few others have done also in a different way. The second piece is we have also many associates and partners who may not have the succession planning in their own firms or in their family and many of them have been with us for a long time. So we also start thinking about how do we kind of ensure some continuity? And yet, you know, they have an ownership because they have a relationship in that neighborhood, in that catchment. There's a lot of respect. And we also have a lot of care, because they have been with us for 25-30 years. So that's another factor that we're keeping in mind. And therefore, yes, we will continue to experiment with formats. It's not so much from capital scarcity, but also from the point of view of, is there some merit and advantage in doing so, because increasingly the business is more complex also and many franchises may not have that level of organization depth to be able to manage some of these things. So we are also looking at it from that perspective. But having said that as an organization and as a brand we are not wanting to run too many stores on our own, and especially not beyond the top 10-12 cities in the country because it's more complex for us to manage. Whereas our presence is across 300 odd towns. So we will still be a largely franchised  \\nnetwork with limited cities where we will do (ourselves). And that too only stores where we have large turnovers at stake. Vishal Gutka\", \" Got it. Sir, have one bookkeeping question. What is the store opening guidance for Tanishq for FY'26 domestic business? How many stores are we planning to open? Ajoy Chawla\", \" 40 to 50 stores. But more importantly, we are also looking at 50 to 60 stores of existing stores being either renovated or relocated or adding additional space. When I say additional space, it's like adding an entire store. So a transformation program is underway in the last 2-3 years and it will continue in the next 18 months and the headroom on that front is rather more high compared to even the headroom on the network. While we will continue to grow the network into new catchments and cities, even this is a big piece of our growth. Vishal Gutka\", ' Got it. And the 50-60, most of them will be L1 format, right, for you? Ajoy Chawla', ' No. Most of the, in fact, new ones are likely to be franchised L2 or L3. Very few will be L1. Vishal Gutka', ' No, Sir, I am talking about the renovation part. You told that 50-60 you are planning to renovate, refurbish? Ajoy Chawla', ' No. Those are also mixed L1, L2, L3, all formats. We have in fact transformed 160 odd stores in the last two years, which are a mix of franchise and company. Vishal Gutka', ' Great, Sir. Wishing you all the best for future projects. Thank you. Ajoy Chawla', ' Thank you. Moderator', ' Thank you. The next question is from the line of Devanshu Bansal from Emkay Global. Please go ahead. Devanshu Bansal', ' Hi, congratulations on a great performance and thanks for taking my question. Sir, from balance sheet perspective, there has been an increase in our working capital and that has sort of led to some fall in our return ratios also. This is obviously due to increasing gold price and related volume consumption. How do you plan to deal with this as gold prices are continuing to increase? So there is a significant working capital increase. So how do you plan to deal with this? Ashok Sonthalia', \" Yes, so largely you are right. This is all on account of gold price increase. And of course, some investment of inventory is done in some of the catchments. If gold price continue to rise like this, while we have some levers of increasing our GOL level, etc. etc. but it would certainly require some more capital investment from our side and for which our balance sheet can be leveraged, it is capable, but idea would be then to leverage GOL more. And it is very unpredictable, what would be the gold price trajectory going forward. We will wait, watch and  \\nsee and kind of keep responding to the evolving situation. But yes, you are right, in the current context, a little bit of strain on working capital has come in. And the year end number which you see which Ajoy already spoken about, Akshaya Tritiya being early there has been up stocking towards the end of March. So the balance sheet number which you see is a point number that's not the story for the full year. Devanshu Bansal\", \" Understood. Ashok, also if you are open to sort of call out the exact quantum of the hedging gain this quarter, you are calling that out? Ashok Sonthalia No it's not that significant that we should call it out, it is not that significant. But it is one small factor in that marginal EBIT margin which you see. So nothing so significant that we start calling it out. Devanshu Bansal\", \" Understood. Sir, last question from my end. The overall jewellery you said is 20%. Can you call out the secondary growth in studded sales? So reported it's 12%. What is secondary growth in studded sales for Q4? Ajoy Chawla\", ' Yeah I will tell you.. its around 10% - 12%. Almost similar. Devanshu Bansal', ' Okay. Very nice. Thanks for taking the question. Moderator', ' Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jay Doshi from Kotak. Please go ahead. Jay Doshi', \" Hi, thanks for the opportunity. My question is on industry practice of exchange and cash back in case of studded jewellery. Now, in a hypothetical scenario, if the consumer behavior changes and if consumers start exchanging more studded jewellery in future and buys gold jewellery, or basically take cash back. So that could have a significant impact on profitability for overall industry. So, I was just wondering, is this something that comes up in Board discussions or industry association discussions? As an industry leader, how comfortable are you with this policy that you have today, where basically anyone who has potentially bought any studded from you in the past 10-15 years can always come back and give it to you at 10% lower price or 15% lower price versus the current pricing. And that's because, you know, partly there's a big gap between your procurement costs for diamond and your retail pricing for diamond. So, want to understand from a risk management perspective, is this something which you think about? C. K. Venkataraman\", \" Yes, Venkat here, just some perspectives. In India, the category of jewellery is so much about store of value and in a way the exchange policies reflect that customer need and therefore even the lower, relatively lower gross margins in this industry in India because of the store of value concept because customers don't want to lose when they exchange. I am talking in general, I will come to your diamond jewellery point in a minute. So that depresses the markup potential in India versus let's say in the US, it's not a store of value, it's an accessory. The markups are like other accessories. Now in a way related to the store of value concept, because also of the  \\nconnections to culture, tradition, and feeling of wealth, people don't like to sell jewellery. They exchange jewellery, but unless there is a calamity in the family, they don't sell their jewellery. And it's in a way related to the store of value and of course also related to the ‘dhan’ aspect of jewellery. And therefore, like we have had this policy for, you can exchange gold as well as diamond jewellery for cash. That policy has been there for more than two decades, but the incidence is really, really in the decimals, in the small decimals because of this. So unless generational views on the subject changes, which may be 20 years, 30 years, 40 years, and that's a very long time for us to talk about here, this is not a, because it, it does not materialize in its actual incidence on this. And even what you're asking, which is people coming in with diamond jewellery, exchanging it for gold, you know, that incidence is very, very low. Jay Doshi\", ' So basically exchange proportion is broadly similar and that has not changed whether it is for gold or diamond in the last 2-3 years. C. K. Venkataraman', ' Gold to Gold, Gold to diamond, yes. Because diamond is an upgrade product for those who never had diamonds. Ajoy Chawla', \" Yes and just to add a little bit, I have personally seen many customers be extremely delighted when they come back after several years and say, wow! my diamonds, my gold, everything is appreciated, that feel good factor is so much that she is very happy to in fact upgrade and add a lot more and therefore the upsell we see on exchange out of that goodwill and in fact the statement they make is only a Tata Company like this would give me such appreciation I seeing. So actually, we are we see a lot of positivity and the risk factor hypothetically does exist but it hasn't yet played out like this so far and we hope it doesn't. Jay Doshi\", \" Very helpful, very clear. Second question is, in FY'25, your standalone jewellery growth was 21% and EBIT growth was 12%. Now with you maintaining your EBIT margin guidance and the ballpark expecting growth to be in 15%- 20%, do you think FY'26, even notwithstanding the volatility in gold we have seen and the (product) mix changes that we continue to see, you think that that gap will now narrow? I mean, your EBIT growth also will be ballpark in that range, 15% to 20% or maybe a couple of percent point short of topline growth. Ashok Sonthalia\", \" If we are going to maintain an EBIT margin then it has to be. Otherwise there is no way, we will be able to maintain EBIT margin. So that's the expectation. But the market is very, very and while this is the current view and if circumstances change dramatically then we may have to get back to you guys talking about it, but right now whatever we see with that we think yes we be able to grow at the similar pace. Ajoy Chawla\", \" I will just add one more piece. Our priority to continue to grow topline and acquire customers is the highest and sometimes we may be willing to invest some of that margin into growth. And that's been the outlook and that's also been the guidance from our Board and everybody. So  \\nmargins may sometimes come down if the competitive situation or the consumer sentiment is adverse. Jay Doshi\", ' Thank you so much and congratulations Ajoy on your appointment as MD. Ajoy Chawla', ' Thank you. Moderator', ' Thank you. The next question is from the line of Harit Kapoor from Investec. Please go ahead. Harit Kapoor', \" Yes, good evening. I also had a question on competition. There are two aspects to it. In an environment of sharp increase in gold prices, are you saying that, we have not seen a pickup from say, regional, private, smaller guys who probably would be sitting on higher inventory gains on schemes, etc. They had that intensity not accelerated. And the second part to that was, you explained gold metal loan quite well. I just wanted to understand is the availability of the gold metal loan and the fact that it is stretched because of the higher gold price is also a source of competitive advantage for you because you're Titan and you can kind of get it at a lower rate as well as have probably, you know, infinite kind of capital and so on. Just could you shed some light on these two aspects? Ashok Sonthalia\", ' So gold on loan, your observations are right. We are in best position in the industry as far as India is concerned. To leverage gold on loan, get the best rate and substantial amount of limit without any concern from the banks compared to other where they would kind of beyond a point will not like to extend. So that gives us a competitive advantage and ability to invest in inventory at higher gold prices. The first question was... On the demand side, competitive intensity.  Ajoy Chawla ', \" Yes, those who don't hedge do sit on inventory gains and they are willing to let go of margin and they play it out in the form of heavy discounting on making charges. And it is not just restricted to small players, it is also even larger players. Not every large player is hedging 100%. So it does play out. So yes, but we also then respond in whichever way is appropriate for that market. And therefore, it's a complex, constant gain share, invest in providing value to the customer in some form. Brand, customer experience, product design, making charges, everything comes together as a value proposition. Harit Kapoor\", \" My question is this, why again this question was because the pace of gold rise has been so sharp this time. Maybe there could be more investment by large private, small private, regionals, you're saying it's a manageable scenario right now? Ajoy Chawla\", \" Yes, I think it's not new now. I think it's, if you asked me last 12 months to 15 months has continued to play like that and we just got used to this. Harit Kapoor\", \" Got it. And the second part was on couple of data points on the World Gold Council data. One was it said that exchange as a percentage has not dramatically gone up in spite of prices going  \\nup so sharply, which means that the new buyer growth might have been a little bit more surprising. It should have probably fallen off a little bit more in the industry. And the second was on the fact that the overall demand growth is in value terms is 3%. So on these two points, you are growing far, far faster as you have been historically. Has the shift kind of further accelerating in this rising gold price environment towards organized players and are you surprised that you're still seeing by a growth in spite of this dramatic increase in gold price and exchange is not dramatically gone up. Those are my questions. Management\", \" So exchange has gone up somewhat. If I look at this Quarter 4, the contribution exchange has gone up by a couple of percentage points. That is one. New buyer growth specially in gold has flagged off. And certainly, as I said in the lower price bands. So, it's not that we are blazing away to new buyer growth in gold. In fact Quarter 3-Quarter 4, it has been very muted. And therefore higher growth in ticket size which usually comes from higher repeat, so the skew between repeat and new has been there. Some of the overall new buyer growth percentage figures you're seeing is true with the overall portfolio because Mia has opened a lot of stores etc. and that is giving us some benefit in the new buyer growth, so but if I dissect it by brand and go into by store and channel there is, and by category, there is a similar point as what World Gold Council has said. But exchange has gone up certainly in contribution by a couple of percentage points in Quarter 4. Harit Kapoor\", ' Thank you. Wish you all the best. Moderator', ' Thank you. The next question is from the line of Tejas Shah from Avendus Spark. Please go ahead. Tejash Shah', ' Hi team. Thanks for the opportunity and congrats on good set of numbers. So just one question to the team. So you mentioned that our wait and watch stance on the LGD continues. But just to clarify, is the focus on assessing long term customer relevance of this offering? Or are we still evaluating the economic viability of the business model here? Ajoy Chawla', \" I think it's both. The first one is certainly very important, what do customer's think. And customers are not that clear. They are pretty confused and many others, there are people who would like to experiment. There are people who are getting a little worried about the prices. There are many new customers who come into diamond jewellery and what the authentic piece. They are not so confident. So right now, I would say, in the balance, there are many more people who are already diamond buyers who may be buying LGDs. And many new to the category are still a little hesitant. And I think the store of value that Venkat talked about pretty much plays up high in their mind. But definitely the customer piece is more important. Economic piece, we can figure out once we know what the customer really wants and how it plays out. Economic piece is how we manage the business.  \\nTejash Shah\", ' Is this read through same across our engagement with customers here and abroad or it changes because the store of value understanding also changes? C. K. Venkataraman', ' Sorry, what is the question?  Tejash Shah', ' Is this read through on customers, is it same across in India and abroad or abroad because the store of value dimension is different? Over there, it is slightly different than how we are reading customer in India and LGD. C. K. Venkataraman', ' At the moment, and Diny can add, at the moment, our focus in the US, the most evolved market in overall situation. Indians are more Indian in the US than in India. And the store of value is quite pronounced there as well. Tejash Shah', \" Lastly, are there any regional nuance that we would like to call out in this quarter's numbers in terms of North, South, or any read through there on demand? Ajoy Chawla\", ' I think East and South continue to lead the growth and West and North have been a little more sluggish and within that again West maybe a little bit more than North, has been sluggish. But that seems to have been the trend of the previous Financial Year that just ended 31st March. Tejash Shah', ' Thanks a lot. Thanks and all the best for coming quarters. Ajoy Chawla', ' Thank you. Moderator', ' Thank you. The next question is from the line of Vivek M. from Jeffries. Please go ahead. Vivek M.', \" Hi team, good evening. Three questions from me. First on LGD again, one more question. On the LGD side, is your worry more about given you are the market leader in jewellery, you do not want to let's say create or create is the wrong word, I think expand the market because we have seen someone like let's say retailer like Trent, who has also entered into this. So is it more about you don't want to in a way cannibalize your own business of existing diamond business by creating more awareness? Is that the hesitation, the reason for hesitation? Ajoy Chawla\", \" We are trying to understand what the customer wants and frankly that is what guides us. And how is the customer thinking about it. And we are still seeing customers are a little unsure. Trent has got into it as purely an independent decision and it's not something that, that is not playing in our mind at all. We need to be clear what is the value proposition we need to offer to the customer. And at a next level, we need to be clear what will be the source of differentiation and continued competitive advantage in a category which could get very easily commoditized because of price. So these are important considerations for us. And I don't know whether you should call this hesitation or examining and reflecting as to what is the right thing to do.  \\nVivek M.\", \" Okay. And is your internal view also that that LGD will have no impact on let's say natural diamonds or where you are on that bit? Ajoy Chawla\", \" Very difficult to answer that question because how it plays out will depend on whether new customers will... Will the market expand? That's the big question. And if the market expands and penetration of diamonds which is as low as 15% in our country goes up, even by a few percentage points, it can bring many new customers and it can be a win-win. In the short run, there may be lot of ups and downs. The dust will settle somewhere. Very difficult to predict. Some pluses and minuses can happen. But I think we need to look at it over a slightly longer period and see where the dust will settle. Vivek M.\", \" Got it. My second question is, know, there are obviously at least globally whatever and I have admittedly very limited understanding on this, but I hear that part of the reason why natural diamond prices actually went down were because of LGD. But what we, there was a recent media article which said that natural diamond prices actually moved up 10%. I think this was in the month of March or end of March I think. Do you have any insights as to what drove this change and is that something more, I don't know secular is the right word or not but I would still use that. So is there something which is happening which is why natural diamond prices moved up? Ajoy Chawla\", \" Again, I think this reflects the wholesale prices of roughs and again on the higher caratage. It is probably on the back of Chinese demand perhaps coming back. I don't have more insights on whether it will go further up or that was the bottom and from here on it's up, difficult. Only the rough suppliers and what happens in international markets will really determine the price on that. Very difficult, I don't have an answer to your question, sorry. Vivek M.\", \" No, I appreciate. Thank you for that. My last question is on the sequential basis, we have seen jewellery margins actually moving up and Ajoy clarified that there is no major hedging impact because of which the margins have moved up. And our channel checks actually indicated in the last few months given how gold prices moved up, especially in the 4th Quarter fiscal. There was a lot of, let's say, discounts or making charges, promotions given by regional players, local players. Why is it that this has not shown up in your numbers? What am I getting wrong over here? Ajoy Chawla\", ' See, the gross margins have been impacted because of the product mix. No question. I think Ashok did share fair amount of observations on the fact that there is a mix of operating leverage and some hedging gains, contango etc. So those pieces have played out in the EBIT margin percentages that you have seen. Gross margins have certainly got impacted on two counts. One is product mix, the other is the price of gold itself playing a role in the studded margin line-item level as well. We explained that earlier before when prices of gold go up relative to diamonds, there is an impact on the gross margin for the studded jewellery line item itself. So the combination of these two has impacted gross margin. Sorry, and the sequential piece that my  \\ncolleague here reminds me is also because the studded ratio in Q4 versus Q3 is different. Q3 is a rather more gold season. In Q4, we have a lot more diamonds. So that could be another factor. Vivek M.', \" Right. When I said sequentially, I was looking at all the rolling 4 quarters, for example, the only thing was what Ashok mentioned was there is no big impact of any one off on the EBIT side except the operating leverage, right? So in that context, basically the discounting or whatever we saw on the ground, it was miniscule compared to or you did not face that pressure as much except for a slight impact on gross margins which got offset at the, let's say, due to operating leverage. Is that a fair understanding? Ashok Sonthalia\", ' Yes, I think you are right. Vivek M.', ' Got it. Thank you very much. Very useful. Moderator', ' Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question for today. I would now hand the conference over to Mr. Venkataraman for closing comments. C. K. Venkataraman', ' Thank you very much for all those piercing questions and the encouragement as always. See you in the next quarter and good night. Moderator', ' Thank you.

      "['\\nModerator', \"  Ladies and gentlemen, good day and welcome to Titan Company Limited's Q1 FY  '26 Earnings \\nConference Call . As a reminder, all participant lines will be in the listen -only mode and there \\nwill be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes. Should you need \\nassistance during this conference call, please signal an operator by pressing star t hen zero on \\nyour touchtone phone.  \\n Please note that this conference is being recorded. I now hand the conference over to Mr. C.K. \\nVenkat araman, Managing Director, Titan Company Limited. Thank you and over to you, Mr. \\nVenkat araman.  \\nC. K. Venkataraman\", \"  Thank you. Hello, everyone. It's been a very satisfying quarter for Titan Company across \\nbusinesses, markets,  and subsidiaries.  The results have been published and the deck has also \\nbeen up for review, so I will hand over for the questions to start.  \\nModerator\", '  The first question is from the line of Devanshu Bansal from Emkay  Global.  Please go ahead.  \\nDevanshu Bansal ', \" Hi, Sir. Congratulations on a good margin performance across segments. First question is on \\ngrowth for jewellery  segment.  The rest three quarters have a relatively higher base, obviously, \\nbecause there was a 900 -bps duty cut that happened. Do you foresee some growth moderation \\nin the rest of FY  '26 or we should be able to sustain the momentum that we have seen in Q1?  \\nAjoy Chawla\", \"  You are right, Devansh u, that quarter 2 particularly had a higher base effect, has a higher base \\neffect going forward because of last year's custom duty reduction and some deferment from \\nquarter 1 into quarter 2 because people were on the fence. So, I think 22nd or 23rd July onwards, \\nwe saw that impact. So, that is one factor.  \\n The other factors are, of course, we have been constantly using the leverage of ticket size growth \\nand repeat customer base that has given us good results, even while gold prices are high. I am \\nnot sure to what extent this should manifest in quarter 3 and quarter 4 in as much as it may \\nmanifest , the base effect may manifest more in quarter 2.  \\n But it is too early to conclude anything and I would say that we started well in quarter 2. Of \\ncourse, we have had to advance the Festival of Diamonds which has the studded activation and \\nthat has helped us. So, overall, I would wait and watch.  I would not necessarily come to any \\nconclusion given the significant uncertainties that we are seeing every day due to external factors \\nand therefore consequent impact on gold prices.  \\nDevanshu Bansal \", \" Thanks for this. Secondly, I wanted to understand on margins. There is indication that there is \\nsome 50 bps of one -off in this segment for Q1 and there was some one -off in Q4 as well.  Firstly, \\nI wanted to understand what is the nature of this and whether both these one -offs are expected \\nto reverse in the rest of F Y'26? \\n Subsequent margin question is also that if we exclude this one -off, there has been still a pretty \\nrobust margin performance as the mix was weaker due to lower studded and higher coin sales.  \\nSo, do you see scope of beating the upper end of your margin band which is 11 %-11.5% in F Y \\n'26? \\nAshok Sonthalia\", '  Hi, Ashok here. So, in this quarter, we had a benefit of INR 100 crore s one time distributed \\nequally between jewellery and watches. In watches division, we have some valuation of \\ninventory which we do annually, our runs and that is what has led into this benefit.  \\n Every year a small benefit do come because of the input costs and wages going up, but this time \\nit was pretty marked and that adjust watches division reported margin by almost 4%. Like 22  \\npoint some percent  we have reported, you should think that 4% will be this one time and actually \\nthis one time will reverse  as we move forward in quarter 2, quarter 3  when that inventory which \\nhas got re -valued  get liquidated, it will hit the COGS  and to that extent watch division has to \\nkind of absorb this thing.  \\nAs far as jewellery is concerned, we have about which accounts for about 50 basis point s. This \\nis also one time outstanding hedging because of so much volatility in the market. There is MTM \\nagain sitting in our favour and which will also as these forwards and futures gets squared up in \\nquarter 2 and quarter 3 , this will also reverse itself. So these are the two major reasons in this \\nquarter which has benefited overall company as well as jewellery and watches in particular.  \\nAs far as going forward is concerned, apart from these r eversals which would happen in quarter \\n2 and quarter 3 and several actions which are being taken by jewellery division in particular to \\ntackle whatever pressure they have, but we will not say that we will operat e at upper end or \\nlower end. 11 to 11.5 still remains our guidance on which we are trying to work on.  \\nDevanshu Bansa l', ' Understood. Thanks for this. Just a follow up so that Q4 gain that was there that will also reverse \\nin the  coming quarters?  \\nManagement', '  Quarter 4 I don’t think there were something very specific and I am trying to remember what \\nexactly was it significant. I don’t think anything was significant, but  I will just review that and \\nmaybe during the call I will revert back.  \\nDevanshu Bansa l', ' Sure.  \\nModerator', '  Thank you. The next question is from the line of  Avi Mehta from Macquarie Capital. Please go \\nahead.  \\nAvi Mehta', '  Hi team. Thanks for the opportunity. I wanted to get your thoughts on the market share in the \\njewellery segment.  Now for the last few quarters we have seen a situation where our same store \\nsales growth momentum has been lagging the other larger listed players. So I wanted to know \\nhow are you seeing this and what do you envisage is the way forward?   \\nIs this something that is beca use of the size and is expected, w ould love to hea r your thoughts \\non that?  \\nAjoy Chawla', \"  Hi, Avi. Ajoy  here. See I think given the construct of the jewellery market, it is a multipolar \\nplay. It is not just two players or three players fighting for share amongst each other and therefore  \\nit is not easy to conclude.  There are at least seven, eight  large national players. There are 8 to 10 \\nlarge regional chains and then there is a host of regional players who are selective to given cities \\nor states or markets.  \\nSo typically we believe even last year we have gained market share and we triangulate it in \\ndifferent ways.  We look at overall market data. We look at our own tracks. We look at World \\nGold Council data , all of that. So to us last fiscal, last financial year we have gained market \\nshare. In some markets we may not have gained.  \\nIn some other markets we have gained. So national picture I am telling you.  In quarter  1 our \\nunderstanding is we have sustained market share when I look at the total  market . This is after \\ntriangulating all these data points that I shared with you. And how it will play out I don't know. \\nBut our base certainly is much, much higher.  \\nAnd, therefore, in certain markets where our base is very, very high and many of the other \\nnational players are kind of entering there on a small base early entry. In those markets it may \\nsuddenly look like our same store growth is comparable to the same store growth of s ome of \\nthose other players. But very often we see that it is possible that growth is there in many players \\nand some share is lost by regional players.  \\nSo it becomes very difficult to assess. So when we look at it, we look at the market share on the \\ntotal addressab le market in that segment. Quarter  1 summary, we have I think sustained share \\nnationally.  Last year we had gained share marginally I would say in the previous year.  \\nAvi Mehta\", \"  Got it, Ajoy. Ajoy where I am coming from is, is this a case where the segment that we cater to \\nis where we are gaining market share or is it more a geography mix? That's the clarification that \\nI wanted to understand mor e than just a follow up on that?  \\nAjoy Chawla\", \"  It's a geography mix I would say and i n a way, g eography also leads to segment b ecause certain \\ngeographies are more towards gold, some geographies are more towards studded and some to \\nhigher value, some to lower value, b ut to answer your question simply geography  led is what I \\nwould say.  \\nAvi Mehta\", '  Got it. And just a follow up, sorry not a follow up but just a second question that leads to it. \\nFrom a margin point of view now  you have a range of 11 to 11.5 . Wanted to understand is margin \\nat all a lever to change or which we need to evaluate to remain competitive or this is not the right \\napproach when you look at the segment.  So that is the last part?  \\nAjoy Chawla', '  So we are not constraining growth by way of trying to somehow keep a high margin. We have \\nbeen very competitive and aggressive when it comes to gold rates. We have been very responsive \\nin those markets.  In fact, we have also consolidated a lot of that. We have also been quite \\ncompetitive when it comes to introducing products, especially in the gold segment at lower \\nmaking charge and lower complexity.  \\nAnd we are seeing that product mix also play out in a particular way.  We have introduced gold \\nintensive studded products also. So many of these we have done keeping in mind both consumer  \\nand competitive response. We have not held back on retail, let us say expansion or renovations \\nand increasing the footprint of our existing stores.  \\nAnd we have continued to invest in marketing in as much as it is needed. So none of our growth \\nengines we are holding back on. And, therefore, I do not know whether you are referring to \\nwhether we can do more of those and compromise some of the margin.  We have not really gone \\nout there and cut our investments in growth to kind of fund margin.  \\nAvi Mehta', '  Very clear. That is all from my side.  I will come back in the queue for the other questions. Thank \\nyou. \\nModerator', '  Thank you. The next question i s from the line of Videesha Sheth  from Ambit Capital.  Please go \\nahead.  \\nVideesha Sheth', '  Yes, hi. Some of my questions have been answered. So just one from my side.  With 9  carat  also \\ncoming under the purview of hallmarking, how are you thinking of exposing multiple formats, \\nmultiple brands of y ours, be it CaratLane or Mia o r maybe even have a separate brand. I \\nunderstand that you have already launched certain a ssortment under 9 carat  and Car atLane and \\nMia last quarter, b ut just wanted to know where do you st and or where will this karatage  we \\nfocused on?  \\nAjoy Chawla', '  So Mia is still early days. Carat Lane has  done a lot more work on 9 carat  and I will let S aumen \\nanswer that.  \\nSaumen Bhaumik', \"  Hi. We launched 9  carat  diamond jewel lery in the last Valentine. And it was kind of a response \\nto the gold rate was spiral ling upwards.  And it was certainly putting a lot of pressure on the \\nmargin structure of the company. And we were also v acating price points and Carat Lane were \\npredominantly playing between INR 30,000 to INR 40,000 rupees. And a lot of products which \\nwere at top 30 moved away from that price band.  \\nSo we needed to fix. So 9  carat , 14 carat  are ways to sort of make sure there is enough and more \\nrange for the customer to look for. And since then it was originally only online play.  And \\nthereafter we started placing it in limited number of stores. So far we are seeing a very steady \\ntraction. The hesitation that we had and we launched it even before 9  carat was hallmarked.   \\nMeaning announcement of h allmarked happened immediately . But we have been seeing a steady \\ngrowth of this. There are people who are buying the jewel lery, 9 carat notwithstanding, diamond \\njewel lery and pretty comfortable with this.  And we didn't see any resistance at all whether it's \\nonline or offline.  \\nSo our view is that with the gold price increasing, all those earlier resi stance of customers \\ntowards karatage. I think especially in the lower segment which is not more on the adornment \\nspace, less on the let's say investment space, I think it's going to be the way. And we are banking \\non it and therefore we are expanding it.  In fact, we just decided that we'll be taking it to all 300 \\nstores very soon.  \\n  \\nVideesha Sheth\", '  Okay. I understand it’s early days, but do you believe it warrants a separate format or would you \\nbe playing t his specifically through CaratLane and M ia only?  \\nSaumen Bhaumik ', ' For Carat Lane I will speak here is that customer who are looking for price points, more often \\nthan not is in the gifting segment. So they come with a budget. And within that, I suppose if  we \\nhave an offering, it plays out well.  \\n And 9  carat  is basically addressing this issue of gifting which we are not able to otherwise cater \\nto after gold price went up so much. 14  carat was the initial step and now 9  carat is the next step. \\nSo I suppose it is a segment we were actually -- that is the segment Car atLane lost some \\ncustomers below 30,000. It is in a way our effort to get back those customers in the cash flow.  \\nAjoy Chawla', \"  But I don't think it needs a separate brand. Even in Mia, as we roll it out, it is going to be under \\nthe same brand. In fact, M ia also sells a little bit of silver.  It is under M ia brand only. So I don't \\nthink it will require a separate brand or format, b ut it may have a greater play online is my sense \\nbecause of the price point it can cater to.  \\nVideesha Sheth\", '  Got it. And the second question was around Studded Jewel lery. Any indications beyond besides \\nCarat Lane, any indication on improvement of the studded ratio or studded assortment?  \\nAjoy Chawla', \"  I didn't follow the question. What do you mean by any indication?  \\nVideesha Sheth\", '  Sorry i s there any indication of the overall studded portfolio growth picking up versus the 11% \\ngrowth which we saw this quarter?  \\nAjoy Chawla', \"  Well, we hope it will pick up. And already we advanced our Festiva l of Diamonds. We had the \\noffer t hat has given us good results in July. How it will play out for the rest of the quarters and \\nyear, we will wait to see. We always target.  The good part, I will tell you the buyer growth on \\nstudded is actually better than the buyer growth in gold jewel lery. I am keeping coins aside. And \\nthat indicates that there are many more customers, new customers,  and new buyers in the market \\nfor studded relative to, let's say, gold.  \\nSo that's a positive sign. Of course, how we leverage our repeat business and repeat buyers to \\nalso give us ticket -size lead growth to complement this will determine how well we grow in the \\nsubsequent quarters.  \\nVideesha Sheth\", '  And this buyer growth which you are referring to in studded being better versus plain gold, that \\nwould be inclusive of CaratLane  or excluding CaratLane?  \\nAjoy Chawla', '  Excluding CaratLane. CaratLane is separately tracked.  \\nVideesha Sheth', '  Understood. Thank you.  \\nModerator', '  Thank you. The next question is from the line of Tejas Shah from Avendus Spark. Please go \\nahead.   \\nTejas Shah', '  Hi. Thanks for the opportunity. For a change, I will start with watches and then eyewear.  So \\nwatches delivered exceptional quarter. So what led to this growth and how should we think about \\nsustainability of the same?  \\nSuparna Mitra ', \" So it was many things that we had been working on for many quarters kind of came to a pinnacle \\nof results. Premiumization as well as in the volume side, a lot of work on mass customization, \\nespecially for brands like Sonata and Fast rack. So we've seen exceptional growth across \\nchannels, both retail as well as multi -brand and e -commerce.  \\nI think it was that was building up and this qua rter was probably  where it all kind of came \\ntogether very well. In terms of continuing, of course, this was an exceptional quarter. We are \\nhoping quarter 2 will also be good and festive  we will wait and watch. But things are looking \\ngood and quite solid from a building block point of view.  \\nTejas Shah\", \"  And on the eyewear, despite store closures, we are delivering decent growth. So what's the \\nstrategy there going forward?  \\nN.S. Raghavan\", \"  Yes. Hi. This is Raghavan here.  Yes. We have been reimagining the eyewear business in terms \\nof what is the CVP  (consum er value proposition) . So for us the positioning of Titan Eye  Plus is \\na multi -price and a multi -brand so that we are able to cater to a larger set of an audience.  So as \\nfar as store closures are concerned, stores which we believe are not performing well and stores \\nwhich are not relevant are the ones which are being closed. So this is something which we will \\ncontinue to do.  \\nParallelly, we're also opening stores. So it is the stronger consumer value proposition and a \\ngreater shopper experience is what we believe is leading to a greater engagement with the brand.  \\nTejas Shah\", '  Sure. And last one, if I may. Given the U.S. tariff environment, are you seeing any impact on \\ndemand pricing or sourcing strategies for the international jewel lery business, especially in the \\nU.S.?  \\nC. K. Venkataraman ', \" First quarter has gone pretty well. W e were aware of the build  up towards the tariffs and we had \\nprepared everything on the ground to deal with it. And actually we have done very well in the \\nfirst quarter of FY26. But the current signals are quite volatile and we don't want to take any \\nknee -jerk reaction with respect to pricing because the claims  are at a bloated level.  \\nAnd we'll wait out August to end to see what finally develops. To finally administer the price \\nthat we think we should go with. So that's on the price.  On the sourcing and because the U.S. \\nshare to our company sales is just about 2% or a little more than that, it's not a deal breaker for \\nus to approach this in any knee -jerk fashion. We can just wait it out and calmly do that.  \\nAs far as supply chain is concerned, the international business is becoming, jewel lery business \\nis becoming bigger and bigger for us.  With our recent entry into the GCC in a bigger way through \\nthe new investment, the GCC business itself of jewel lery will be very large soon. And that \\ncombined with the U.S. could top 6% or thereabouts of the company sales. And by itself, it \\nmerits independent of tariff advantages.   \\nIt merits thinking about global supply chains in those parts of the world. And that's something \\nthat we are starting to think about and explore. But no concrete plan to share at the moment.  \\nTejas Shah\", '  Got it. Thanks and all the best.  \\nModerator', '  Thank you. The next question is from the line  of Siddhant Dand from Goodwil l. Please go ahead.  \\nSiddhant Dand', \"  Yes, hi. I had a question regarding T EAL . Could you speak more on the numbers, the scalability, \\nthe sustainability of this quarter's numbers and the semiconductor business that we are doing?  \\nC. K. Venkataraman\", \"  Yes, so Siddhant, hi. There are three parts to the TEAL  business. One part is the manufacturing \\nservices business where traditionally our customers have been aerospa ce customers from outside \\nIndia a nd that sector is starting to improve. Our ability to move up the value chain from parts to \\nminor subassemblies has been successful over the last few years. And we're seeing more and \\nmore traction.  \\nFor example, if you were to take a company like Raytheon or a Pratt . Our ability to move \\nsideways into other parts of Raytheon, other parts of Pratt is giving us annuity businesses. And \\nthat business is actually an annuity business. And once you strike a deal after a year or a year \\nand a half of preparation, it's for many years . So that is a sustainable business. And we certainly \\nexpect to continue growing in the manufacturing services side.  \\nThe second part is the automation solutions, which has got two parts.  One is the traditional \\nautomation where it's a bespoke automation and assembly and testing solutions, which we've \\nbeen very good at both in India and outside India. And that continues to – it's not that – it's not \\nan annuity business. It's not that predict able.  \\nAnd it – but because of a decent mix between automotive, CPG, medical and some other \\ncategories, we have built a certain predictability and also the international versus domestic  \\ncertain predictability about and there's a lot of EV -related work that we are doing in that. The \\nthird is for a single large global customer, which uses the capabilities of the same automation \\nsolutions business, which is now – and it's also related to the recent acquisition of a co mpany \\ncalled Justech that TEAL  did some time back.   \\nAnd that's a third stream, which is more like a product business, but it uses the capabilities of \\nthe same automation services solutions division.  So these are the three parts. And because they \\nare very different from each other, in a way it also gives a good balancing mix to the predictable \\ngrowth.  \\nWe are very, very excited about the overall growth prospects of TEAL  because the , for example  \\nRaytheon, we keep getting the best supplier award from Raytheon and that's given to the top 10 \\nor 15 suppliers out of 12,000 -plus suppliers globally, and TEAL is one of them. Therefore, the \\nreputation that TEAL has today for creating very high -end technology solutions and very reliable \\nsolutions is very strong. So, from a sales growth point of view, we are very, very bullish. From \\na profitabil ity, I wouldn't commen t about the future.   \\nSiddhant Dand\", \"  Okay. That's wonderful. Thank you so much.  \\nModerator\", '  Thank you. The next question is from the line of Harit Kapoor from Investec. Please go ahead.  \\nHarit Kapoor', \"  Yes. Hi. Good evening. So, my first question was on the watches business again. So, even \\nadjusting for this INR  50 crores, this 18.5% EBIT  margin is extremely strong and way ahead of \\nour expected guidance. So, just for the full year, is it likely to be a higher profitability year for \\nwatches or is there something sustainably that you think is going to be at the higher end now? \\nThat's my firs t question.  \\nAshok Sonthalia\", '  I think we are hopeful that mid -teen kind of number we should be able to deliver full year basis \\nfor FY ‘26. Yes.  \\nHarit Kapoor', \"  Got it. Got it. And just to follow up on this, analog seems to be doing significantly better. There's \\nnot much of talk of wearables in your release now. Is there a shift in the market or a mean \\ndiversion that's happened towards analog, if you could just give some sense on  that?  \\nSuparna Mitra\", '  Yes. This is Suparna here. So analog for us is doing really well, as you saw the numbers. Smart \\nwatches have gone through a big correction. I think a lot of it happened last year in calendar year \\n‘24. It continues to be somewhat subdued right now. A lot of  correction in terms of oversupply, \\nundercutting of price, etcetera.  \\nWe were relatively better off. So we are at this point maintaining and gaining market share and \\ncoming out with newer products which should do well. But yes, the very overheated kind of \\ngrowth that we have seen in smartwatches in calendar years ‘21, ‘22 and ‘23, that phase is over \\nnow.  \\nHarit Kapoor', \"  Got it. And the last question was on Tanishq. Over the last two quarters, you've seen a slower \\nrate of store expansion, even this quarter, three stores. So, just wanted to get a sense, is this year \\ngoing to be slightly more back -ended? How do we see that?  \\nAjoy Chawla\", \"  No, plans are broadly similar. It's probably just timing issues of execution. Quarter one, I agree \\nwith you, was slower than our own plans. How much of it we'll catch up in quarter two, I can't \\nsay. But our plans for the year are pretty strong. And usually , we try to squeeze in many more \\nstores just before festive season, which happens to be earlier this year in October. So, I'm hopeful \\nthat quarter two, we should be able to catch up on some of the...  \\nC. K. Venkataraman\", \"  Also, I'm not sure whether the square feet thing is that apparent. No?  \\nAjoy Chawla\", '  Yes. \\nC. K. Venkataraman', '  For example, just to illustrate, like, I was personally there in the small town, Brahmapur in \\nOdisha, where the existing Tanishq store was totally reimagined to a much, much bigger size. \\nSo therefore, the strategic importance of that may be missed in the number.  \\n  \\nAjoy Chawla', \"  Yes. So just to get to that point, for example, in quarter one, while we opened three new stores, \\nall of them bigger size than earlier, we also relocated or expanded significantly about eight other \\nstores, which are -- which is part of the retail transformation  program that's going on. All of that \\nis really helping on increasing the total retail capacity in terms of square feet.  \\nC. K. Venkataraman\", '  So we can highlight this, Venkatesh, in a better way maybe, just think about it.  Yes. So that was \\njust an additional point.  \\nHarit Kapoor', '  Great. Thanks and we wish you all the best. Thank you so much.  \\nC. K. Venkataraman', '  Thank you.  \\nModerator', '  Thank you. The next question is from the line of Amit Sachdeva from UBS. Please go ahead.  \\nAmit Sachdeva', \"  Hi. Good evening and thank you so much for taking my question. Sir, my question is on the \\nstudded growth, which is 11%, and I think, it's been going on in the same range for the last two \\nquarters, three quarters. But surprisingly, CaratLane  continues to grow strongly in 30s, and you \\nalso make a point that premium solitaires, they are up 60%.  \\nAnd you also sort of given a mix of revenue in the slide, which is studded versus gold, and that \\nincludes CaratLane  and the numbers seems to be unchanged. But then does it signal that in the \\nstudded segment, the ticket sizes now are coming down? And is there something consumer \\ntrends are telling us at Tanishq or Zoya level or at least the premium formats level, while t he \\nmarket is going towards more affordable diamond jewellery ? How should we see the trend? And \\ncould you also update what is the diamond over all market would be in India level studded market \\nand how the market growth is happening?  \\nAjoy Chawla\", \"  Okay. Many questions rolled in one. But at a broad level, Amit, studded market, our best \\nestimate, and this could vary based on whom you ask the question to, is around INR  75,000 \\ncrores, give or take here and there. Last year, I think we did around in Tanishq, Mia, Zoya. And \\nif I were to add CaratLane put together maybe around INR  17,000 crores, INR18,000 crores. \\nOkay, and maybe something like that, but you can pick the figures there.  \\nNow, is the market growing? The studded market is certainly growing overall. In fact, even if \\nyou listen to what De Beers and etcetera, commentary, India is probably one of the few markets \\nwhich is growing in studded and we are now the second largest market for diamonds in the \\nworld.  \\nNow, the question that you're asking is, is there a studded, we've been seeing a slightly \\ndichotomous behaviour in the last two levels. One is between solitaires and non -solitaires. We \\nsaw the correction happen in solitaires, particularly in the higher karatage, because of the price \\nuncertainties that the media narrative also played out. That has n ow stabilized because now that \\nis in the base, okay? And therefore, last year, if I were to look at it, the studded jewellery grew \\nbetter than solitaires.   \\nAmit Sachdeva\", '  Okay.  \\nAjoy Chawla', '  Now, that bit has got equalized, if you ask me. Now, the second…  \\nAmit Sachdeva', '  Okay.  \\nAjoy Chawla', \"  Piece is on price. The other dichotomous behaviour that we saw was on price band. In fact, I \\nwas mentioning this even earlier that in this quarter as well as last year, we actually saw better \\nbuyer growth in studded than in gold. So, actually, number of cu stomers is there. Now, the value \\npiece, as you rightly pointed out, is it that people are migrating to a lower price band? I am not \\nso sure about that. I think a lot more newer customers are coming in, who come in at the lower \\nprice band, give n India's demography, given a lot of young working women, people wanting \\nevery day. So, I think it is certainly growing.  \\nThe higher value segment, if I look at it, is doing pretty well. If I look at the INR5 lakh plus, for \\nexample, in Tanishq as well as in Zoya, we are seeing fairly good growth. In the sub INR2 lakhs, \\nif I look at Tanishq, Mia, CaratLane put together, the po rtfolio is growing fairly well. Some \\ngives or takes may be happening between the three, let us say, formats and three retail chains or \\nthe three brands. I do not see that as a big issue.  \\nAmit Sachdeva\", '  Okay.  \\nAjoy Chawla', '  Value growth will come, I believe, if we are able to excite the customer, even in the INR  2 lakh \\nto INR  8 lakh space, where I think a large number of customers today would be ready to buy. \\nSo, I think a lot of it is to do with market development and that is an opportunity and an agenda \\nfor us.  \\nAmit Sachdeva', '  Got it.  Okay. Thanks.  \\nC. K. Venkataraman', '  One other thing, I think, for all of us also to think about, the association of CaratLane with \\nTanishq has been there for so many years, and therefore, somebody who is buying a CaratLane \\nis well buying also into the Tanishq sub -brand, whatever you call it.  And therefore th e while the \\n-- from a standalone point of view, we look at the jewellery division of Titan Company and from \\na total point of view, we look at CaratLane as a subsidiary. The customer is looking at the choices \\nfrom the sa me company in a way. And therefore, that 11 of Tanishq and maybe 25 of Mia and \\nthe 35 of CaratLane, all that is from a price point of view, you have to integrate and see and not \\nhow come CaratLane is growing at 25 while Tanishq is growing only at 11.  \\nSo, in a way, many of the what one would call a budget kind of customer of Titan Company is \\nbuying between Tanishq, CaratLane and Mia. And maybe more and more of them are buying \\nMia and CaratLane because  those are primarily with that appeal, whereas Tanishq is premium \\nhigher value primarily. So, those are the -- so we have to see it together also.  \\nAmit Sachdeva', '  Got it. No. That is very, very helpful Venkat. Thanks so much for that. And can I just ask a small \\nfollow up on, given the gold price is very high and most jewellers have tried to make a light  \\njewellery and several SKU innovations to excite buyers and including lower karatage – lower \\nsort of karatage as well. So, my question is that, has that changed some competitive dynamics \\non making charges? Just to get a sense of that. Are you seeing at the margin things are same or \\nhas that been a little bit more intense on pricing front?  \\nAjoy Chawla', \"  I am not sure if the two are connected. We will reflect on it. But one thought which you said that \\nlighter weight and perhaps lower karats also. Even in gold, we have experimented with 18 karat \\nin certain market s. And we have seen a good response to that. Therefore, we see greater \\nopportunity in studded. 18 carat going to 14 karat and then Saumen talked about 14 going to 9. \\nSo, lower karats are being accepted in the market. So, that is one route. Lower weight is another \\nroute in gold also.  The second part of the piece on making charges, I think as the gold prices \\nhave gone up, there is a sliding effect on the customer's willingness to pay for more complex \\nproducts, higher making charges.  \\n So, even at the higher price point, some customers are preferring to go towards slightly lower \\ncomplexity products and therefore the making charges do come under pressure sometimes. So, \\nI think it is more to do with gold prices at the rate -- at the high l evels they are. And making \\ncharges, yes, that will perennially remain, but it is more or less same like what it was before, \\nbetween us and competition.  \\nAshok Sonthalia\", '  Just one point which I wanted to add on previous conversation which was happening and Venkat \\nwas saying, if you see amid this time the disclosure, the way we have made in quarterly update, \\nas well as in our presentation, where we are bringing the whole jew ellery including CaratLane \\nand international piece separately, just to bring that point also alive that there might be interplay \\nbetween Mia, Tanishq , CaratLane  on certain segment, and we need to start looking at totality. \\nAnd you would ha ve also noticed that international business has actually turned positive \\noperating profit in this quarter.  So the whole change in disclosure also is intended to drive that \\npoint that we start – we need to start looking the revenue growth and overall margin, etcetera, in \\nthat manner.  \\nAmit Sachdeva', '  Thank you so much, Ashok, and thank you so much for the disclosure as well. It is very, very \\nhelpful and thank you so much for the detailed answers. Thank you, Ajoy, and thank you, \\nVenkat. Thank you, Ashok. Thank you so much.  \\nModerator', '  Thank you. The next question is from the line of Percy Panthaki from IIFL Securities. Please go \\nahead.  \\nPercy Panthaki', \"  Hi, Sir. Just a question on lab grown diamonds. I know we have been discussing this on and off \\nin the quarterly calls. But I think it's been probably four or five quarters since we all first raised \\nthe question as to how Titan is looking at LGD and whether it w ants to have a play in this or \\nnot. \\nAnd we are seeing now news items on several relatively small but PE funded players who are \\ngoing to set up LGD stores over the next couple of years. We will have significant supply coming \\ninto the Indian retail market. It's not as if LGD is not available n ow. But proper retail frontage,  \\nenough number of touch points, square feet, etcetera. That we have not seen till now which I \\nthink over the next two years will come in.  \\nSo the question is, do we want to participate in that at all or, I mean, that's something that, \\nbecause we are a natural diamond player, we don't want to get into that and we believe that while \\nthey might garner a certain amount of sales, we will focus onl y on the other part of the market. \\nSo just some thoughts here.  \\nAjoy Chawla\", \"  I think the push has been coming from your cohort, from all the analysts, etcetera, more often \\nand because there is a lot of media narrative.  I will make 2 or 3 comments after that you can \\ndraw your conclusions.  \\nOne is that let's be honest today , despite 50 odd players and maybe more coming in and 100 plus \\nstores and several online players as well , the narrative is far larger than the reality. The reality is \\nthat, the lab grown market estimated by us is less than 2% of the total diamond studded market , \\nas we speak.  \\nIt could go up of course in the future , nobody is denying that. But this is where it stands.  This is \\na hard reality check. The second observation and comment I want to make is that prices of lab \\ngrown diamonds have been coming down , retail prices as well, not just the wholesale price.  \\nWholesale prices come down much faster. Retail prices in India are hovering between INR \\n30,000 to INR 50,000 a carat. About a year ago it was much, much higher , and everyday new \\nplayers are launching and they are coming in at lower price points as well. Entry barriers are \\nrather low. Differentiation is also very limited as we see in the market.  \\nSo, there is a very strong chance that unless you come up with a good IP, this could get a very \\ncommoditized play , where  price point led bigger stone or more stones or more diamonds for less \\nprice is where it may head. A few players may land up differentiating , so we have to see.  \\nConsequently, unit economics at the store level can come under huge pressure. You are right, \\nPE funds are backing.  And therefore , you may see a plethora of stores more coming up. Maybe \\nanother 100, 200 stores can easily come up in the next one year itself. I believe that will further \\ncommoditize the play.  So, for Titan to make a meaningful play, one, the consumer should be \\nexcited and there is something that she wants. Two, what is the IP that we can create? And three, \\nunit economics have to start making se nse. \\nBut we are not being dismissive of it. We are constantly watching, studying, analysing,  and \\nreally reading what is going on at the customer and the industry level. And therefore, we will \\nsee what to do.  We will reserve the right to play the way we want to play when  we want to play.  \\nPercy\", '  Okay. Secondly , this 11% studded growth, is that number including Ca ratLane?  \\nAjoy Chawla', '  No, it excludes.  \\nPercy', '  Including Car atLane, I mean , as a company as a whole, what is your studded growth?  \\nAshok Sonthalia', \"  We'll just …  \\nAjoy Chawla\", \"  We will work out and send it to you. I mean, I don't know.  \\nAshok Sonthalia\", '  Venkatesh will kind of share that.  \\nPercy', \"  I don't know if that 11 % materially changes or maybe just goes up to 12 %, 13% or something \\nlike that. But my question on this was  that -- see, we have traditionally always held that we are \\nnot too focused on the studded percentage , because of gold inflation ; gold jewellery is selling \\nmore and that percentage has naturally come down.  \\nBut we have a good , absolute growth in studded. Now, that is not true for this quarter. So, \\nabsolute growth itself is on the lower side.  So, what is driving this absolute growth to be low? \\nAnd is it just a quarterly one -off? Or is there some pressure , which can continue for a longer \\nperiod of time?  \\nC. K. Venkataraman\", \"  Percy, you are very right on that first point that you mentioned. We were always focused on the \\nstudded growth. And whatever is the consequent share , because of higher gold thing, it's fine.  \\nSo, 11 % is certainly low. The point that I was making and Ashok was also adding to, is still \\nvalid. That whatever is the incremental extra growth that you add with CaratLane , we have to \\nadd. And we will just add that and share with you. That may still not be, that may not top 15 %, \\nfor example, which is lower than our normal growth rate, which is low. So, nobody is...  \\nPercy\", '  So… \\nC. K. Venkataraman', '  We will just confirm on that in a while. But the overall growth for Tanishq , is lower than what \\nwe would like, without doubt. It is 16% including CaratLane , by the way.  \\nPercy', '  Okay.  \\nC. K. Venkataraman', '  But the target for Tanishq is certainly more than 11 % and we are behind on that. But I guess the \\noverall consumption situation today is an issue.  And this is playing in that consumption constraint \\nsituation. So, obviously, we have to innovate more in the competitive intensities also. And \\neverybody is chasing diamond jewellery, I am sure, for profit reasons and all that.  \\nThese are general statements without any,  connecting the dots. But they are real. Even if I cannot \\nconnect the dots, they are real because customers are exposed to constraints on the pocket, I \\nmean, the money.  And, of course, choices from the competition side.  \\nSo, obviously, the company and the Tanishq brand need to innovate more, execute better to \\ngrow. So, that is the only comment I would make on this.  \\nPercy', ' ', \" On this one last follow -up on the first question on the LGD part. See, again, just your take on \\nthis because right now the situation is too nascent and we don't have any real data. So, I am just \\nasking your take on it for the future.   \\nBasically, see, in US, etc., we have seen LGD penetrate into mainly the solitaire category and \\ntake a substantial share of the solitaire category. In India, the solitaire category is quite small. \\nWe are a small diamonds market.  But even in a small diamond market, there is a significant \\nprice arbitrage.  \\nSo, let's say a piece which costs INR 80,000 in natural diamonds, that similar kind of piece in \\nLGD might cost, let's say, INR 30,000  – INR 35,000 in the LGD segment. So, the Indian \\nconsumer being a little more price sensitive, especially at the slightly lower end, of course, a \\nINR 5-lakh – INR 10-lakh customer , is not going to shift because he might be interested in \\nnatural diamonds only.  \\nBut let's say a customer in that price point of INR 70,000  – INR 1-lakh, is it likely that if he is \\ngetting it at 50 %, 60% cheaper that he might shift to LGD? Even if, let's say, the business \\neconomics of LGD as a business is not very attractive, but what is your take on the market share \\nloss that you might suffer because of this phenomenon?  \\nAjoy Chawla\", \"  So, what you asked is a logical assumption. But what we find interestingly is the people who are \\ninitially considering and exploring LGDs , are the ones who are already accomplished diamond \\nbuyers. They already have enough naturals.  They are people , who could otherwise easily afford \\nINR 3 lakh, INR 5 lakh, INR 10 lakh products.  \\nAnd they are the ones who are saying, okay, why not a little bit, I'll also take some of this because \\nthey can carry off. Second piece is, even in India, the early adopters are the ones who are looking \\nat solitaires and bigger stones because the arbitrage is much larger.  \\nAnd in the INR 70,000  – INR 80,000 or let's say sub  - INR1 lakh space, the kind of customer \\nwho is there is also, many of them are saying that if I am buying something which is,  a studded \\njewellery , I might as well buy the natural thing and the real thing because it holds value.  \\nAnd I don't want to be, she's not yet comfortable migrating wholesale to LGD because it's a little \\nconfusing to her as to whether this will hold value and whether it's a real thing. So, it's really the \\nnature of customers who are currently buying their add itional purchases by people who are \\nalready in the diamond segment.  \\nAnd new buyers, very few may be going to LGD. The new studded buyers are still preferring \\nthe naturals.  \\nC. K. Venkataraman\", '  One of the markers of affluence, moving into a higher status in life, is also diamond jewellery . \\nAnd a lot of households and a lot of women in India, in every society which has gone through \\nthis affluence from $5,000 to $8,000 and so on, per capita, have gone through this.  \\nAnd therefore, the Indian women are waiting to buy the diamond jewellery  at INR 1 lakh because \\nmost of the first -time buyers buy at INR 1 lakh and not at INR 5 lakh.  So, therefore, that first -\\ntime buyer at INR1 lakh is looking for the real thing. And therefore, because if that was the case \\nand with a lot of these brands and stores operating, the sale of LGD should be something else \\nthan 2% that Ajoy  is referring to.   \\nPercy', ' ', ' Right. Very helpful. Thank you very much.  \\nAjoy Chawla', '  Thank you.  \\nC. K. Venkataraman', '  Thank you.  \\nModerator', '   Thank you.  The next question is from the line of Nihal Mahesh J ham from HSBC Securities. \\nPlease go ahead.  \\nNihal Mahesh Jham', \"  Yes. Good evening, team. I had a follow -up question on LGDs, more on the studded part.  If I \\nlook at the last four quarters, even adjusting this quarter, say for the number you've given, \\nincluding CaratLane , just looking at Tanishq, there has been a moderation in the studded growth.  \\n So, I just wanted to understand the reasons as per you , is it maybe a case of LGDs which you \\nsaid is not the case?  Or is it more a case that as diamond prices have not seen any appreciation \\nor they have been contracting over the last 24 months, that that is in a way making people not \\nbeing very keen in terms of investing in diamond or investing in diamond pieces?  \\nAjoy Chawla\", \"  See, last year because  I think I've shared this before, but I'll repeat here. Last year, the studded \\ngrowth in value was impacted because of solitaires underperforming, in fact, showing a decline, \\nespecially the one karat plus and one and a half, two karat plus. If I go back a few years, that \\nwas a very small part or almost a negligible part of our business , we, in fact, grew the solitaire \\nbusiness 3x in a few years, in two or three years.  \\nAnd on that base, there was a correction because there was an issue of what will the price of that \\nsolitaire be going forward, thanks to the strong media narrative. And therefore, amongst a certain \\ncohort of people, including some of us here around this ta ble and yourselves on the call, there is \\nthis overriding feeling that, oh, now diamond does not hold value.  \\nBut that is a very, very small part of the total diamond buying segment in India. And it was \\nlargely on the solitaire. So , if I exclude the solitaires, actually, diamond business grew pretty \\nwell in -line with what you would expect last year.  \\nIf I include solitaires, the higher value, yes, to that extent, it has played a certain role. This year, \\nin the first quarter, therefore, I am delinking last year's and this year's. This year, now, that base \\neffect of the solitaire is no longer there.  \\nThis year, it is a different reason. As we explained earlier and Venkat also talked about the fact \\nthat there is a consumption -related challenge. And we have to figure out how to innovate and \\nexcite the customer, especially in the INR 1 lakh plus, INR 2 lakh plus segment  and in a way, \\ngain share of wallet.  \\nC. K. Venkataraman\", \"  Yes, like today's paper,  25% growth in international travel in FY  '24. 25%. So, and a lot of \\npeople, I remember over the decades, two decades, conversations with customers would say, \\nshould I buy that INR 3 lakh necklace for myself or should we travel together as family to \\nThailand, kind of thing.  \\n  \\nSo, in a way, this discretionary expenditure basket is a wide basket. So, it's a very complex thing. \\nAnd therefore, as the jewellery  becomes really at the top of the list, must buy, if I have money, \\nthen the woman will buy this instead of going to Thailand.  So, that, something like that.  \\nAjoy Chawla\", '  Yes, so, I still feel, given the spread of our business across markets and different segments, \\nclearly, LGD is not the cause for any, because that is still so small, it will not account for any of \\nthis, even at a buyer level.  \\nNihal Mahesh Jham', \"  Understood. One point here, when you're saying the 2% share in value, would it be better to look \\nat it from a karatage  perspective? Because it's at the end of it, one -fifth the price.  So, 10% of the \\ntotal carat age is maybe a decent start. Just asking your opinion on that.  \\nAjoy Chawla\", \"  I don't have a figure to give you, boss. These estimates are very wild. And without data, it would \\nbe crazy to give you any response on this.  Whether it's 2%, 5%, 10%, 8%, 6%, no idea.  \\nNihal Mahesh Jham\", '  Point taken. Just one last question on the margin bit to Ashok, that this quarter, despite, say, \\nstarted going lower, a very high share of gold coin sales, as you highlighted, our margins are flat \\nin jewellery , excluding the one -off benefits. So, maybe operating leverage or some optimization \\nof advertising, given the Festival of Diamonds spends happens in Q2.  If you could just give \\nsome highlights ? \\nAshok Sonthalia', \"  Gold coin share has remained elevated for some time. So, it's not that extraordinary in this \\nquarter  vis-à-vis the earlier quarters. We explained that 50 basis point is, of course, one -off and \\nit will reverse itself.  And the rest is all very, very small, small stock inventory changes, which \\nhas come. And nothing worth making them a definite reason for this quarter.  \\nSo, that is where I will leave this.  And that is why, when the question was that, should we start \\nthinking about higher level of band, I still don't want to guide you to that. It is still 11% to 11.5% \\nand which side of the band, given the market reality, volatility,  and gold prices, we will \\nultimately land up. We don't know.  \\nAnd at the same time, to one question which came that, Ajoy  clarified, the growth and market \\nshare remains our top priority. So, some tactical investment, if required, we will not constrain \\nourselves that we are going to breach 11% and whatever is the right for the business will be \\ndone.  \\nAjoy Chawla\", \"  And sometimes some timing of costs may also affect us between quarters. So, I wouldn't read \\ntoo much into one quarter's exact figure. And last year quarter might have had some other timing \\nissue.  This year quarter may have some other timing issue. So, I think it is better to look at it \\nover a slightly larger number of quarters.  \\nNihal Mahesh Jham \", ' Thank you so much.  \\nAjoy Chawla', '  Thank you.  \\nModerator', '  The next question is from the line of Abhijeet Kundu from Antique Stock Broking . Please go \\nahead.   \\nAbhijeet Kundu ', ' Thanks for the opportunity  given . It was just more of an accounting question. In both jewellery, \\nthere is a 50 bps impact of hedging.  And in watches, there is a sort of a 400 bps benefit of \\nrevaluation  of -- of (inventory) revaluation , which you said will reverse in the forthcoming \\nquarters. So, from a modelling angle, when we have to take recurring PAT or recurring EBIT, if \\nthis is reversing, then we can consider it in the recurring PAT rate. I mean recurring PAT and \\nrecurring EBIT rat e, both this one -time items ? \\nAshok Sonthalia', \"  If they are going to reverse in quarter -2 and quarter -3, it will be opposite impact. And that is \\nwhere someone asked about watch. After adjusting, it is becoming 18%, but this 4% also will \\nfurther reverse.   \\nSo, 18% has to come down and that is where I guided mid -teen is much more reasonable \\nexpectation from watch division. It could be 16%, I don't know. It could be 14%, but mid -teen \\nballpark is fine.  \\nAnd for the same thing, jewellery. Sometimes it may happen that there are so many things, very \\ndifficult to predict particularly on some of these aspects, that while this is reversing and \\nsomething else is kind of offsetting that. So, we will discuss more if that happens.  \\nBut yes, these things would reverse. Jewellery certainly in quarter 2 and quarter 3 would reverse. \\nWatches would take the same time period.  So, next two quarters will have these opposite \\ndirection movement on EBIT margin  pressure . And that you must account for your account \\nkeeping or bookkeeping, whatever you want to do that.  \\nAbhijeet Kundu \", ' And you would be specifying that whatever reversals happen in the second and third quarter, \\nthat would be sort of the way you have given it.  \\nAshok Sonthalia', \"  It has to reverse.  there is no way. But what happens during the quarter, again few things get \\ncreated.  And gets created and slightly complex. I don't want to end the call with,  a very complex \\nexplanation, where we go out of the call not that delighted, which you should all be delighted. \\nAnd we are feeling delighted about the performance.  \\nBut the point is that, say, all the outstanding forwards and future, where MTM benefit came this \\ntime, it has to reverse when these forwards and future gets squared up. But there would be new \\nset of forwards and future and which direction they will operate , we don't know.  \\nNowadays, these are not very meaningful differences once we move to fair value hedge \\naccounting of inventory.  But still, there are some minor differences keep cropping up depending \\non volatility of prices,  etc. Because the basis for evaluation of forward , future and inventory are \\ntwo different bases. They are not the same basis and that creates this kind of differences in these \\nnumbers.  But if something is worth calling out, we will certainly call out.  Okay ? \\nAbhijeet Kundu \", ' Okay. Got it. Thank you.  And congrats on a great set of numbers.  \\nAshok Sonthalia', '  Thank you.   \\nModerator', '   Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question for the day. I now hand the \\nconference over to Mr. Venkataraman for closing comments.  \\nC. K. Venkataraman', '  Thank you very much, everyone. See you in the next quarter.  \\nModerator', '   Yes. Thank you. On behalf of Titan Company Limited, that concludes this conference.  Thank \\nyou for joining us and you may now disconnect the lines.  ']\n",

As a reminder, all participant lines will be in the listen only mode and there \\nwill be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes. Should you need \\nassistance during this conference call, please signal an operator by pressing star then zero on \\nyour touch-down phone. Please note that this conference is being recorded. \\n I now hand the conference over to Mr. Srinivasan Vaidyanathan, Chief Financial Officer, HDFC \\nBank. Thank you, and over to you, Mr. Vaidyanathan. \\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. Thank you, Neerav. Good evening to all. Thanks for participating and coming in today. I \\nwill kick it off. I'll request our CEO, Mr. Sashi Jagdishan, to get started and give some opening \\nremarks, then we will go straight to any questions that you all have. We can go into that. Sashi, \\nover to you, please. \\nSashidhar Jagdishan: Thank you, Srini, and thank you all for joining on this call on a Wednesday evening. We just \\ndeclared our results. And obviously, as you probably know much better than all of us put \\ntogether, we are in the midst of a very challenging macro environment, with tight liquidity \\nconditions, signs of moderating urban demand, a tepid private capital expenditure programs, \\nvolatility and depreciation of the Indian rupee, capital outflows from equity and debt markets \\ndue to uncertainty around the new U.S. administration. However, we also see some drivers of \\ngrowth or some positive signs as well. \\n We are seeing some amount of rural demand picking up. The government spending is picking \\nup after a slow momentum in the H1, the first half of the year. We see continued strength in \\nservices exports and a gradual moderation in inflation. \\n Coming to the bank, we seem to be progressing well in our journey to normalize our credit \\ndeposit ratio with the deposit growth outpacing our loan growth. We have seen robust growth in \\nour average deposits at about 15%, which continued to gain market share. And our AUM \\nadvances growth of 8% year-on-year basis. \\n We have delivered a strong deposit growth despite the challenging macro environment. As \\nprobably you would know, on an average basis, I think, we saw a very near neutral liquidity in \\nquarter 3 with a peak negative of around the INR2 trillion to INR2.5 trillion. NIMs have \\nremained reasonably range-bound and stable despite the headwinds from tight liquidity, leading \\nto a tight pricing environment. \\n We continue to add distribution. I think, over a year-on-year period, on a 12-month period, we've \\nadded about over 1,000-odd branches. But we have been able to maintain a very tight leash on \\nthe cost. Our cost growth has grown 7% year-on-year, which means that we have gained some \\namount of productivity gains there. But the most important part, which is something that we've \\nalways maintained, is our credit  USP. \\n All our credit parameters, be it the slippages, be it the gross NPA, be it credit costs, ex of some \\nof the cyclical patterns in the agri sector, have been reasonably resilient and stable, and which is \""

      "securitization income in fees? And if you could also refresh us with the accounting for any \n",
      "securitization , as in where it should come? That's my first question.  And my second question is \n",

      "used for , because I think the contingent provision look s lower Q -o-Q? \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan : Okay. Mahrukh, I'll take this question on the fees first. Fees at about INR8,000 crores, grew by \n",
      "about 17% year -on-year. Think about the fees, third -party products, the distribution products --\n",
      "have been quite strong. It grew by almost 32% in this quarter , year-on-year.  Year -on-year this \n",
      "quarter to last year's same quarter  -- 32%.  And if you think about all of the retail categories, \n",
      "assets, cards and retail liability, all of those other categories, on a combined basis grew by about \n",
      "15%, 15.5% or thereabout s, right?  \n",
      " Wholesale, which has got certain episodic  within that, we de-grew by about 5%. That's what \n",
      "you're seeing on a net basis, fees growing by about 17% thereabouts. Last quarter was between \n",
      "14% and 15% . So, it's a very similar range anywhere between 14% to 17% is what -- when you \n",
      "look at it over several quarters, you will see that's the range at which the fees growth year -on-\n",
      "year. And quarter -to-quarter seasonality  plays out. That was the first part of the q uestion that \n",
      "you asked on the fees.  \n",
      " On the securitization that you asked, securitization comes with excess spread and the excess \n",
      "spread is not part of fees. That excess spread in this quarter, you know that we did it towards \n",
      "almost the end of the last wee k. So, there's not much of income or whatever is there. But that is \n",
      "excess spread and not a fee . \n",
      "Sashidhar Jagdishan : And Mahrukh, it will be amortized over the life of a loan, nothing is upfronted. So, the fee item \n",
      "is not impacted by securitization a t all. \n",
      "Mahrukh Adajania:  Got it. And will the margins optically look higher than yields from next quarter given that -- or \n",
      "no, not really because they'll be part of investments anyway,  right? Yes. Okay. Sorry, and on \n",
      "contingent provisions?  \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidy anathan : Okay. Contingent provision, if you see that there was a release of contingent provision. There's \n",

      "declared our results. And obviously, as you probably know much better than all of us put \n",
      "together, we are in the midst of a very challenging macro environment, with tight liquidity \n",
      "conditions, signs of moderating urban demand, a tepid private capital expenditure programs, \n",
      "volatility and depreciation of the Indian rupee, capital outflows from equity and debt markets \n",
      "due to uncertainty around the new U.S. administration. However, we also see some drivers of \n",
      "growth or some positive signs as well. \n",
      " We are seeing some amount of rural demand picking up. The government spending is picking \n",
      "up after a slow momentum in the H1, the first half of the year. We see continued strength in \n",
      "services exports and a gradual moderation in inflation. \n",
      " Coming to the bank, we seem to be progressing well in our journey to normalize our credit \n",
      "deposit ratio with the deposit growth outpacing our loan growth. We have seen robust growth in \n",
      "our average deposits at about 15%, which continued to gain market share. And our AUM \n",
      "advances growth of 8% year-on-year basis. \n",
      " We have delivered a strong deposit growth despite the challenging macro environment. As \n",
      "probably you would know, on an average basis, I think, we saw a very near neutral liquidity in \n",
      "quarter 3 with a peak negative of around the INR2 trillion to INR2.5 trillion. NIMs have \n",
      "remained reasonably range-bound and stable despite the headwinds from tight liquidity, leading \n",
      "to a tight pricing environment. \n",
      " We continue to add distribution. I think, over a year-on-year period, on a 12-month period, we've \n",
      "added about over 1,000-odd branches. But we have been able to maintain a very tight leash on \n",
      "the cost. Our cost growth has grown 7% year-on-year, which means that we have gained some \n",
      "amount of productivity gains there. But the most important part, which is something that we've \n",
      "always maintained, is our credit  USP. \n",
      " All our credit parameters, be it the slippages, be it the gross NPA, be it credit costs, ex of some \n",
      "of the cyclical patterns in the agri sector, have been reasonably resilient and stable, and which is  \n",

      "something which sort of shows the strength of institution, not just now, but for a long time that \n",
      "we have been in this business. \n",

      "manner in line with what we had committed to ourselves and to the world at large in terms of \n",
      "the glide path on the CD ratio or the kind of growth levels that we are anticipating. As we speak, \n",
      "we have sufficient liquidity. We continue to grow our deposits faster than the system, we have \n",
      "sufficient capital, allowing us to be very comfortable to grow or capture market share in the \n",
      "loans when macro turns favour. \n",
      " I know all of you would have a lot more questions. So, let me pause out here, and let us take \n",
      "questions from all of you. Thank you. \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: Thank you, Sashi. So Neerav, we can kindly open it up, and we can go straight to questions, \n",
      "please. \n",
      "Moderator: Thank you very much. The first question is from the line of Mahrukh Adajania from Nuvama \n",
      "Research. Please go ahead.  \n",
      "Mahrukh Adajania: Congratulations. First of all, can you give as much color as possible on how you met PSL on e-\n",
      "HDFC's book because your opex does not seem to have increased. And then there doesn't seem \n",
      "to be much RIDF for previous shortfalls, either. So just as much color as you could give on PSL. \n",
      "That's the first question. And the second question is that if you could separately call out the TCR \n",
      "excluding agri loans, and if there was any tax refund in other income, other interest income? \n",
      "These are my questions. \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. Thank you, Mahrukh. First thing on the priority sector. Our priority sector is last year or \n",
      "as we see now, at the aggregate level, we meet the target, 40-plus percent. The only area last \n",
      "year and as we speak now, we see is that small and marginal farmer and the weaker section. \n",
      "There are dual qualifications between them, but that's normally about a percentage points we \n",
      "always look for opportunities. \n",
      " And yes, between there are several products that go for getting that. One is organically grow on \n",
      "balance sheet book. That's one. We do IBPC to buy certain book or PTC's investment book, we \n",
      "buy. We also buy PSLC in the market. So, it is not just opex. The cost of PSL is embedded \n",
      "within our overall ROA structure now and in the past, and it can straddle across various lines. \n",
      " If you originate, you end up with certain credit costs. That's part of how you price it in. If you \n",
      "buy it, you get it in PSLC. If you buy it through investments, you're getting it through investment \n",
      "book, or if you get it through a loan purchase, you get it through loans. So, it can straddle \n",
      "everywhere. But yes, we do look for always, we do need to find that last percentage in the SMF \n",
      "and agri has always been in the past elusive and as we see now, but we vehemently pursuing at \n",
      "the right price to get that. That's part of the first question. We...  \n",
      "Page 4 of 19 \\n \\n \n",
      "Mahrukh Adajania: Sir, just one thing, sorry, one clarification. So, this time around, there was not much PSLC. Is \n",
      "that a fair assumption? \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: No, there's not much. There's not much. Yes, but the year is still not over. And so, as the year \n",
      "progresses, we'll have to see where it ends. \n",
      " Okay. The second aspect is the PCR that you touched upon. The overall PCR, you can see, is \n",
      "about 68%. And you know that the slippages were impacted by agri, which is the seasonal agri. \n",
      "Excluding the seasonal agri, the slippages are flat period-to-period. And so, they are, since they \n",
      "are in the early buckets, the PCR, excluding agri, is at 71%, which is same as what it was in the \n",
      "prior quarter. That's the PCR. \n",
      " The third aspect of it is the tax refunds or whatever. Yes, every quarter, we get something. This \n",
      "quarter is about INR2 billion. Last quarter was about INR0.5 billion or something. And so, every \n",
      "quarter, there is something that comes. And the agri reversals, the interest reversals on agri also \n",
      "go, but that goes to the loans part of the interest on loans. Yes, correct. That is a separate item, \n",
      "yes. \n",
      "Mahrukh Adajania: But what is the agri reversal? \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: So that's again for the NPA, relating to NPA. Now you reverse the interest once an account goes \n",
      "to NPA. And typically, the agri interest reversal is about 1-year interest that you reverse. \n",
      "Mahrukh Adajania: Okay sir, thank you. \n",
      "Moderator: The next question is from the line of Chintan Joshi from Autonomous. Please go ahead.  \n",
      "Chintan Joshi: I've got one on liquidity and then one on your contingent provisions. So, on liquidity, if I think \n",
      "about the last 2 quarters on average, on average balances, you've added about INR1.2 trillion, \n",
      "INR1.3 trillion of excess deposits over loans, and borrowings are only down about INR250 \n",
      "billion. That excess liquidity that you have on balance sheet, at what yield have you parked that \n",
      "liquidity, if you can share that with us? \n",
      " And also, what is the weighted average cost of borrowing that is maturing over the next 2 years? \n",
      "Just trying to understand what the funding synergies will look like over the next 12 to 18 months. \n",
      "And then on contingent provisions, the question is, what is the process of releasing that \n",
      "contingent provision? You released INR3 billion. You obviously have a lot on your balance \n",
      "sheet. Will you be using these provisions to buffer the P&L volatility? And do you kind of need \n",
      "to go to RBI to be able to use this? Or you can use those with your own discretion? \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. Okay. Thank you. First on the liquidity. If you look at our abridged balance sheet, you'll \n",
      "see that sequential quarter, the investments net of cash and cash equivalent is up by about \n",
      "INR500 billion or INR50,000-odd crores, right? It's up. And it gets invested by treasury through \n",
      "various instruments. And the earnings on that can range anywhere between 6.5%, 7%, and it \n",
      "depends on where it lies.  \n",
      "Page 5 of 19 \\n \\n \n",
      " But to give you a context, you wanted know at what rate we invest. But I'll tell you, the G-Sec, \n",
      "the 10-year G-Sec, sub 7%, right? So, you get an idea of where those investments can go. And \n",
      "there are several instruments that we choose to be there. So, it's period-to-period, it changes and \n",
      "gets calibrated by our treasury. And as much as possible, they will optimize what could be done \n",
      "within the overall liquidity scenario. That's on the liquidity front. \n",
      "Chintan Joshi: And the borrowing cost? \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: The second aspect on the... \n",
      "Chintan Joshi: What's the borrowing... \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: The borrowing cost is about 7% -- 8% or so is the borrowing cost that we have had, particularly \n",
      "the borrowings that have come from HDFC Limited come with those kinds of costs, right, 7.98% \n",
      "or so. That includes the cost of the hedges and so on, fully loaded cost, it comes to about 8% or \n",
      "so on the borrowing. And yes, we do optimize. It's a good point that we touched and linked it to \n",
      "borrowing. \n",
      " As part of the treasury management, we do as much as possible link to see what are the \n",
      "opportunities out on the borrowing. There's a maturity profile that you asked for the next 18 \n",
      "months. I think we published some of the maturity profile, which is there. In the annual report, \n",
      "it is there. \n",
      " But in addition to that, I do want to say, opportunistically, we do look at things that we can do. \n",
      "For example, in this quarter, we did buy, call it, INR44 billion or INR4,400 crores of bonds and \n",
      "extinguished. That's part of the ongoing process, especially it manages and optimizes whatever \n",
      "is possible, and we mix and match and do these things. So, I hope that gives you an idea of \n",
      "continuously and dynamically, it gets managed by our treasury. \n",
      " Getting to the contingent provision as such. Yes, I mean, there are signs around the contingent \n",
      "provision. There is a process across various portfolio classes that we employ in terms of what \n",
      "we do and how we assess certain things. If they are NPA, they are part of specific, right? If it's \n",
      "not an NPA, it's not in the contingent at all. Contingent is not something that we foresee, but \n",
      "contingent upon certain event, it can happen or not happen. And we assign various probabilities, \n",
      "and we make certain judgment calls. \n",
      " And there is some process around it, the document process we follow. So certainly, this is not \n",
      "something that is at a discretionary level. \n",
      "Chintan Joshi: So, you released a little bit of contingent provision this quarter. I was trying to understand what \n",
      "led to that release? \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. Good part. Current quarter, there's a large wholesale account, which is performing \n",
      "wholesale account, which means they're not an NPA, performing account, which we had tagged \n",
      "that for contingent provision because our credit risk assessment showed that vulnerability. So,  \n",
      "Page 6 of 19 \\n \\n \n",
      "we provided -- and in this quarter, we received money, we collected cash, and so the contingent \n",
      "was not required. We recovered. \n",
      "Chintan Joshi: Okay. So, we should read that as recoveries rather than -- okay, fine. That answers the question. \n",
      "Moderator: Next question is from the line of Kunal Shah from Citigroup. \n",
      "Kunal Shah: Yes. So, the first question, again, in terms of the overall provisioning coverage, specific \n",
      "provisioning coverage. No doubt you indicated in terms of on agri, it's been flat on a quarter-on-\n",
      "quarter basis. But otherwise, the trajectory has been downward. So maybe, have we reached the \n",
      "optimal level? Or should we see further, maybe, at least, managing the provisioning coverage \n",
      "slightly lower considering the behaviour of the portfolio that we have? So how should we look \n",
      "at that entire trend because last 5 quarters, it's been coming off? \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: Yes. See, the provision coverage ratio is a mix of various products that go in and go out, right? \n",
      "And as you know that when something enters 90, there is some level of provision we do. And \n",
      "as they progress through the delinquent buckets, it gets covered. And so, it depends on the mix \n",
      "of products that come and go. \n",
      " So, in this quarter, if you saw the agri product come and go, it's secured. And again, the mix of \n",
      "secured, unsecured is very relevant in the overall situation, right? And so now you had an agri \n",
      "coming in, we'll have certain level of provision. That is why ex-agri, the provision coverage is \n",
      "71%. And with the way that it is reported, it is 68%. And the vintage of the NPA also matters, \n",
      "right, the newer vintage versus the older vintage and so on. \n",
      "Kunal Shah: Okay. Got it. So maybe if we assume that maybe the stress level remains, we are able to manage \n",
      "it well, then should it be managed at the current level? Or we will see the further decline out \n",
      "there because of this movement, which happened in the NPL? \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: See, there is no one particular formula or whatever, right? It depends on the mix of products, \n",

      "out. \n",
      "Bhavin Lakhpatwala : So Kunal, there's no discretion or judgment from a retail standpoint. It's a product program. It's \n",
      "a mix of the product and the stage of NPA, which will define. It is not necessarily some \n",
      "judgmental call that we take on a quarterly basis. \n",
      "Kunal Shah: Sure. And overall, if you can share in terms of the 100% provisioning policy for the unsecured \n",
      "portfolio, when does that kick in and the write-off policy? And any stress in any of the segments? \n",
      "Maybe the overall ex of agri slippages were almost flat in the absolute term. But any segments, \n",
      "which is worrying you? We are seeing a few of the players talking about stress evolving in some \n",
      "of the other segments as well. Anything that is worrying you at this point in time? \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: So okay. So, 2 aspects of it. One, in terms of the write-off unsecured and so on. The product \n",
      "program in the retail area, each product program is different in terms of what it is, but we touched  \n",
      "Page 7 of 19 \\n \\n \n",
      "upon the unsecured. Unsecured gets written off at 150, which means if an account is not \n",
      "recoverable at 90, there is a very quick P&L take on that, right? So suddenly, you'll see that we \n",
      "hit to 100% provision and then it gets out, right? \n",
      " So that's something very important to note that if you're not able to collect within 90, there is a \n",
      "huge acceleration in terms of the provisioning that happens there. So that's in terms of a couple \n",
      "of unsecured that's there. And each secured will have another kind of 150, 180 and so on. But \n",
      "then this is the kind of a process, again, part of the product program, formulae determined. \n",
      " The second aspect that I touched upon is the quality of the overall book. The quality of the \n",
      "overall book across segments continues to remain stable, which is the retail, the retail unsecured, \n",
      "secured or in the CRB book, the SME book or the SLI book or whatever or the wholesale book \n",
      "for that matter, pretty stable across all of those segments as we see. \n",
      "Moderator: The next question is from the line of Suresh Ganapathy from Macquarie Capital. \n",
      "Suresh Ganapathy: There are 2 questions. One is on the HDB Financials credit costs having gone up quite sharply \n",
      "Q-o-Q from 1.8% to 2.5%. Can you just give us some color what has contributed to this rise, \n",
      "both whether it is secured, unsecured? So just a little bit color on that. And the second thing is \n",
      "on merger synergies itself, right? So, the merger happened on July 1 of last year. If I were to \n",
      "take a snapshot of that point in time, your margins were at 3.4% and cost ratio was 40, 40.5. 18 \n",
      "months down the line, the numbers are still the same. So, nothing has changed with respect to \n",
      "margins or opex. \n",
      " Now when can we start seeing some of these numbers happening? Because it's 18 months \n",
      "already into the merger. When can we see the margins improve, the cost ratios coming down? \n",
      "Any color on that would be great. Not exactly I'm asking for the immediate guidance, but it's 18 \n",
      "months into the merger, so we thought we should see something on these 2 ratios. \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. Thank you, Suresh. I'm going to get started, and then the others can join with whatever. \n",
      "First is the HDB that you touched upon. Yes, HDB did have higher levels of Stage 3 in this \n",
      "quarter. The difference between this quarter and last year was a lot to do with provision, \n",
      "including management overlays due to lowering of the economic forecast and so on. So, the \n",
      "higher levels of provision, Stage 3, in Stage 3. \n",
      " Stage 2, which is very important, because that's where the flows move in as we go along. Stage \n",
      "2 improved from September to December by about 5 basis points or so, Stage 2 improved. But \n",
      "Stage 3 at an aggregate level changed by 15 basis points. But however, within that Stage 3, there \n",
      "are 2 categories that we look at and manage. One is loans that at some point in time this quarter, \n",
      "prior quarter or even 2, 3 quarters ago, moved into NPA, but subsequently have pulled below 90 \n",
      "days, but have not managed to pull all the way to 0 days, which means there are no more 90 \n",
      "days, but still NPA, because they have not come back below 0. \n",
      " So that particular category is higher in this quarter than what it was in September. So that means \n",
      "something slipped and pulled back, but not pulled back enough. So subject to that, the overall  \n",
      "Page 8 of 19 \\n \\n \n",
      "Stage 3, right, is up by about 5 basis points or so in this overall category segmented book, which \n",
      "is for a couple of notches below the bank category segment, 5 basis points is within the reason \n",
      "and the provisions were based on that purpose. So that's on the HDB as such. \n",
      " The second aspect on the merger and the merger benefits and so on. See, there are several \n",
      "dimensions to the merger. Certain basic metrics like getting the liability accounts opened, we \n",
      "are like 96%, 97% successful for any new to bank incremental mortgages coming in. So that's \n",
      "part of the beginning, and it comes with some INR30,000, INR32,000 balances 1- to 2-month \n",
      "instalment. \n",
      " So, we are making good traction on that. The second traction is that out of the 4-odd million \n",
      "customers, we need to get the liability accounts open for that balance so that we get into not just \n",
      "a mortgage product relationship, but the overall banking. About 1.9 million of them so far, we \n",
      "have been successful to bring them on the liability relationship. \n",
      " We have more to do on that one, right? So that's the second. And then we have another about \n",
      "0.25 million or 250,000 customers or so, where we not only have this, we have other multiple \n",
      "other products like credit card products and a few other products we have started. \n",
      " Another dimension to the merger is also about the branches, how many branches we have to get \n",
      "through various, not just those 2,500, 3,000 branches, but broader. But if you look at over the \n",
      "last 6 months, 80-plus percent of the branches have been able to do at least one. So, it depends \n",
      "on customer demand, but at least we made a good traction that capability at the branch level to \n",
      "open is there. \n",
      " Now coming to the other dimension of it, which is get to the margin, the cost to income and so \n",
      "on and so forth. Yes, the margin, we started with 3.4% has been in a stable band over the last \n",
      "several quarters, and the good amount of the tailwind that has come to reduce the borrowing \n",
      "cost, which is what we managed to get a good amount of borrowing down, has been offset by \n",
      "the CASA, right? \n",
      " Again, it's a customer behaviour. We have a choice to make in terms of whether we want a \n",
      "holistic customer relationship that includes time deposit, which grew at 22.7% in this quarter, \n",
      "right? Or we don't get that time deposit and look for only CASA so that the margin can go up. \n",
      "That's a choice to make. But then I think the business leaders did make the choice to say that we \n",
      "need to keep that customer relationship alive and growing. So, it's not about, so that in the course \n",
      "of time, we will get the CASA coming. So that's another aspect of it. \n",
      " Sashi, I don't know whether you want to add cost to income... \n",
      "Sashidhar Jagdishan: Suresh, also, I mean, let's also look back into perspective that the environment at which was \n",
      "prevailing at the time of announcement of the merger or at the time of the merger in July 2023 \n",
      "was completely different from where it has progressed from then on and where we are witnessing \n",
      "at this very moment in time. Obviously, on a static basis, I would have agreed with you, probably \n",
      "we could have done better. But when you look at the dynamic environment that we have been  \n",
      "Page 9 of 19 \\n \\n \n",
      "witnessing since the merger, we have seen a kind of a shift in terms of what we need to reorient \n",
      "ourselves. \n",
      " I mean, at that point in time, we were contemplating of growing our business in a manner similar \n",
      "to what we have been doing for a long period of time in terms of gaining market share even on \n",
      "loans. But then when the macro started to change, when liquidity started to tighten, when the \n",
      "outlook on credit started to change negatively as we recall and you would recall that in February \n",
      "of '24, I mean, as early as February'24, we called out to say that we are changing our tack. \n",
      " We said that we will grow. We will try and bring down the credit deposit ratio as quickly as \n",
      "possible over a 2- to 3-year timeframe. FY '25 will be lesser than the system. FY '26 will be in \n",
      "line with the system. FY '27 will be faster than the system. So obviously, this means that in FY \n",
      "'25, as you have seen now with an average AUM growth of 7%. This is in line with what we had \n",
      "envisaged. So obviously, some of the parameters that we were talking at the time of what you \n",
      "were expecting or what we were expecting at the time of the merger does not hold good and we \n",
      "have to recalibrate ourselves. \n",
      " So in the light of that, to maintain stability, which is what Srini was mentioning and being range-\n",
      "bound means that I think the company has been resilient enough instead of going northwards in \n",
      "some of the key metrics and metrics and parameters, we've been able to maintain in a range-\n",
      "bound manner, which itself shows that as things start to get better from a macro environment \n",
      "perspective, from a liquidity perspective, when deposit prices start to come down. \n",
      " And probably as you have seen, we have all seen that as prices come down, CASA ratios will \n",
      "also move up, you will have a kind of a shift in some of the metrics, which is in line with what \n",
      "you and I would be expecting, etc. I think that perspective needs to be factored in, in terms of \n",
      "why we continue to be stable and not sort of having an upward trajectory on some of the metrics, \n",
      "like margins or downward trajectory on cost to income. \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: On the cost to income, I want to add that we are at about 40.5% or so between 40%, 41%. It's \n",
      "been stable at that level. Two aspects to it. If you look at the rate of growth of cost, about 7.5% \n",
      "or so rate of growth of cost, right? The country's inflation is between 5% and 6% at an aggregate \n",
      "level and depending on the wage and so on and so forth, it's getting maintained at that level, sub \n",
      "8%. \n",
      " One other context to that is that despite we have added 1,052 branches in the last 12 months. So, \n",
      "we've added that and managing the cost in the tight leash. I will continue to make those \n",
      "investments in technology. The technology component of the costs is north of 10% right now. It \n",
      "used to be in single digit to high single digit. Now it's north of 10%. So, continuing to make \n",
      "those investments that are required. \n",
      " Lastly, I do want to add, it's not just about the cost to income, which is a function of the \n",
      "numerator and the denominator. So, we also talked about the margin impact there. If you look \n",
      "at the cost to assets that were about 1.93% or so, is very tight and is one of the best in-class cost-\n",
      "to-asset basis. I just want to leave it there and hope that gives you some perspective, Suresh.  \n",

      "Suresh Ganapathy: Thank you so much. \n",
      "Moderator:  Thank you. Next question is from the line of Pranav from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.  \n",
      "Pranav: The first question is on your loan yields. I mean if you look at the bank's loan yields today, it's \n",
      "meaningfully lower than peers versus the long-term history, where even if you include the retail \n",
      "mortgages, the loan yields were much higher. Now if you look forward, let's say, over the next \n",
      "2 to 3 years, do you think the absolute loan yields will converge with peers? Or do you think \n",
      "only the risk-adjusted yields will converge? \n",
      "Or will the lower risk adjusted yields be the price to pay for scale? So where do you see it \n",
      "progressing next, not next few quarters, but more like a 2- to 3-year outlook? \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. Yes. See, there are 2 aspects to it. If you look at the current composition of a risk weight \n",
      "density, which in one of our pages that we have, it's been stable at about 67% or thereabouts. \n",
      "There is great density. That means the assets, RWA to total assets at about 67%, it's been pretty \n",
      "stable if you look at the RWA to funded and non-funded post the conversion factor at 63% or \n",
      "so. And if you benchmark this to some of the peers, you'll see that it's at least 5 to 7 percentage \n",
      "points or thereabouts lower, right? \n",
      "So that means the risk density on the book appears to be lower. That's one. The second aspect of \n",
      "it is in a strategic sense, when you look at it in a couple of years, where the yield is, yield is a \n",
      "function of the mix. And as the retail, which over the last 12 to 18 months, we have been cautious \n",
      "in terms of the retail. Even before our overall loan book, we started to pare down the rate of \n",
      "growth. The retail rate of growth was even earlier taken down, the rate of growth, by our credit \n",
      "through calibration of credit models. They took down the retail. \n",
      "So, it's a function of the mix. We continue to make investments in retail people and product and \n",
      "technology. We do expect that the retail mix will go up. And so thereby, the yield on the overall \n",
      "book should trend up. And thereby, you will see that the risk weight density also move up \n",
      "because where retail comes up with the higher risk weight assets. \n",
      "Pranav: Got it, Srini. So, sir, if let's say, you see a convergence in the risk density, there's no reason why \n",
      "we would be at a lower yield compared to peers? \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: I didn't get that. \n",
      "Bhavin Lakhpatwala:  The way you think about this is finally a customer segment. And historically, we've been \n",
      "operating in a slightly segment, which is comfortable with us. And hence, you would find that \n",
      "historically as well, our risk-weighted density is lower. So, the convergence, to my mind, would \n",
      "happen if the risk undertaken from all, since you're saying from a market is similar or no. \n",
      "Pranav: Understood. The second question is just technical one on your trading and MTM income. You \n",
      "just had like 3, 4 quarters, 3 quarters of low gains from securities, etcetera. Is that a one-off? Or \n",
      "is that something that we should expect to continue? How do you see that trend going forward?  \n",

      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: So, this quarter was a very modest number in terms of the growth. Yes, where is it? \n",
      "Bhavin Lakhpatwala:  One of the things that has happened is we inherited certain equity investments, and that is also \n",
      "going through the P&L, which is showing up in the line that you're speaking about, the mark-to-\n",
      "market, which is coming. \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: Yes. In this quarter, particularly, we've had almost INR2.5 billion or so negative mark-to-market \n",
      "on an equity position that we have inherited, that we have taken through the P&L. It's a negative. \n",
      "Pranav: Understood. So, ex of that, there's nothing that's changed fundamentally? \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: No, fundamentally… \n",
      "Moderator:  The next question is from the line of Rikin Shah from IIFL. \n",
      "Rikin Shah: Yes. So, the first question is on the employee headcount. So, after dipping in 2Q, the employee \n",
      "headcount has again gone back to 2,10,000. And we have seen that some of the peers have been \n",
      "trying to stabilize the headcount and letting the natural attrition happen. So how should we think \n",
      "about the employee headcount going ahead? That's question number 1. And question number 2, \n",
      "Sashi did allude to his earlier guidance that this year, we should be growing slower than system \n",
      "next year in line and FY'27 faster. \n",
      "But in that context, while we are gaining deposit market share at around 16%, there is still \n",
      "inherent macro restrictions. And within that construct, the deposit growth can't be significantly \n",
      "higher. So how confident do we feel about growing in line with the system for next year. Does \n",
      "that guidance still hold? \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. I'll start off on the headcount. We have about 210 or so, about 2,500, call it, around 3,000 \n",
      "people added in the quarter. And over a period of last quarter, we did actually come down. So, \n",
      "if you look at a 6-month or a 9-month period or even 12-month period, it is just 2,000 from last \n",
      "December to December. So, we held down. Again, the reason is that we have ramped up some \n",
      "investments in people and maintained at that level. And we are working through various \n",
      "productivity models to enhance the value. \n",
      "Essentially, that means getting various tools to these people to utilize better for engagement. \n",
      "That doesn't mean to say we will not add going forward. We take it every quarter at a time in \n",
      "terms of -- these are mostly frontline, right? In fact, even across the book, we have 85%, 90% of \n",
      "the book touching the customer headcount, touching the customer in some manner or the other, \n",
      "right? So, depending on the need and the traction, we will add. But again, we are circumspect in \n",
      "terms of getting the right kind of productivity before we can add. \n",
      "So that's on the employee as such. The second aspect of the growth rate, how do you get to the \n",
      "growth rate in line with the market from where we are. Rikin, one thing to note is that there is \n",
      "not a product that we have exited or a geography that we have exited. We are there in all  \n",
      "Page 12 of 19 \\n \\n \n",
      "segments, all products, in all geographies. I'm sitting on liquidity, right, and with, of course, \n",
      "capital tailwind, which is there. \n",
      "Currently, the rate of growth is consciously calibrated either through credit models, a good \n",
      "amount of the retail I'll put it in that bucket, or calibrated through price models because we do \n",
      "see tightening prices, tightening spreads in the non-retail. In the corporate world, the spreads are \n",
      "tightening, right? So somewhere between these, it has been calibrated. \n",
      "So, it is -- and the resources to get these loans up at the scale at which we want continue to be in \n",
      "the system, continues to be engaged. So, it's a question of at the right time that we want to dial, \n",
      "as Sashi was alluding to in his opening remarks, as the macro turns and we feel comfortable, the \n",
      "dial can be taken off. \n",
      "Moderator: The next question is from the line of Nitin Aggarwal from Motilal Oswal. \n",
      "Nitin Aggarwal: I have 2 questions. One is that you alluded to the difficult macro conditions in your opening \n",
      "remarks, but HDFC Bank definitely continues to navigate well through this environment as \n",
      "overall slippage rate remains better versus peers. So how are you looking at the credit \n",
      "environment in respect to unsecured loans in the commercial banking business? Because these \n",
      "are the 2 segments that we have been still growing. And given the vulnerability that you see, \n",
      "how like confident you are to maintain these slippages, run rate and the credit cost overall? \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. Good point, right? One, as we see now, the book is pretty stable, has performed both on \n",
      "the unsecured front or on the commercial side that you talked about, has been pretty stable. And \n",
      "that is part of the credit monitoring model and the collection analytics that go to be in front of \n",
      "the queue to do all of that. I mean, there are various factors that go in. So, all of those factors are \n",
      "at play and have been a top notch in terms of keeping it pretty stable. \n",
      "And one other important aspect of you looking at being stable is, the ratios are stable despite the \n",
      "slowness of the book, which means the book is not growing at 12%, like the industry grows, the \n",
      "book is growing at half the trade. Even when you slow it down, the ratios and the numbers look \n",
      "pretty stable that essentially vindicates the position of the origination quality as well as the \n",
      "capability in terms of getting the collection accomplished very well. \n",
      "So, I want to leave that thought. So, as we see now, going forward, we're confident of continuing \n",
      "our strength and displaying our strength on these portfolios. \n",
      "Nitin Aggarwal: Right. And we really appreciate that. And second question is just a data keeping one on mix of \n",
      "floating and fixed rate loans. Like how much is repo? How much is MCLR, if you can just share \n",
      "that colour? \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: We have roughly slightly under 70%, which is floating, 30%-odd, which is fixed. And on the \n",

      "Moderator: The next question is from the line of Ravi Purohit from SiMPL. \n",
      "Ravi Purohit: I have 2 questions. One is the NPAs that we got in from the HDFC wholesale book would have \n",

      "some colour ex of that or adjusted for that, what would have been actually deposit growth that \n",
      "we have actually delivered. Those are my 2 questions. \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. All right. Let me first talk to you about that provisioning or whatever, right? There are a \n",
      "bunch of contingent provisions that we have done in the past. And to the extent that I just alluded \n",
      "to for another question about when there is a cash recovery, we feel confident and until then, we \n",
      "remain provisioned on certain things. Now then we released the INR30-odd billion that I talked \n",
      "about, INR3 billion that I talked about. The other aspect of it is, this is a good point that you \n",
      "raised. \n",
      "We do have almost about 15 basis points of our NPA, which are performing, right? They are \n",
      "performing. But historically, in the erstwhile organization, they were restructured. But since they \n",
      "were restructured per the RBI regulation, we have marked them as NPA, 15 basis points. They \n",
      "are performing, but it is part of that NPA, which is there, right? So, I do want to bring your \n",
      "attention to that. \n",
      "And the last aspect that you talked about is the deposits that we brought in. And so, the 16% rate \n",
      "of growth on deposits is net of all of that. There are certain categories of deposits, high cost, \n",
      "particularly nonretail high-cost type of deposits, which we did not patronize or let go because to \n",

      "Moderator: The next question is from the line of Param Subramanian from Nomura. \n",
      "Param Subramanian: Firstly, going back to priority sector. So last year, we had a shortfall in both SMF and weaker \n",
      "sections and the one-third requirement from HDFC Limited book. So, both of those PSL \n",
      "compliance will be completed by fourth quarter? Is that the way to look at it? And what \n",

      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: See, it is the requirements have kicked in. And you know that the requirements are 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 \n",
      "over a 3-year period. So, there's a glide path into that. And so whatever, when we have to meet \n",
      "not just for the year end, even for December, for that matter, there is some proportion that kicks \n",
      "in. And that's part of what I alluded to, to say at an aggregate level, we are comfortable for the \n",
      "first 9 months, there is a percentage point or so that we do need to close on SMF and the weaker \n",
      "section. \n",
      "That's part of the plan in terms of how we operate for the next 3 months to close available \n",
      "depending on what is available and at the right price. And of course, the first goal is to \n",
      "organically grow as much as we can. And we don't, alternative instruments are used. \n",
      "Param Subramanian: Okay. Got it, Srini. So, a percentage point shortfall in both SMF and weaker sections. That's \n",
      "probably where we are currently on the merged book? \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: That is correct, yes. \n",
      "Param Subramanian: Okay. That's helpful. Secondly, on PCR. How are we looking at PCR, say, relative to our peer \n",
      "group? Because if you look at it at 68%, we are lower than most of the big private banks even \n",
      "compared to where RBI pegged the system level at 77%. So how are we looking at this going \n",
      "head? \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. First is the 68% to 71% without the agri. That's number one. Number two, the PCR is not \n",
      "something that is benchmark able at the aggregate institution level. We'll have to look at the \n",
      "composition of what the NPA is. If an institution has got a larger composition of the wholesale \n",
      "book, particularly the legacy wholesale book in NPA, and if it is fully provided for, the PCR is \n",
      "higher. And if it is a retail book, it enters as it described to you, particularly the unsecured book \n",
      "as it enters into the 90, there's a level of provision. \n",
      "As it enters into 120, you provide for it. And at 150, you write them off. So, it depends on each \n",
      "institution's policies of what is the provisioning at the entry stage and at the mid-stage and at the \n",
      "end stage, and what is the segment classification in the NPA. Many factors play into this. So, it's \n",

      "Moderator: The next question is from the line of Saurabh from JPMorgan. \n",
      "Saurabh: Sir, just 1 question. On your costs, should we expect a broadly similar cost growth for next year \n",
      "because I mean you're largely done with your branch expansion, employees are not growing too \n",
      "much. So, should we expect the cost lever to be pressed even going ahead? \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: So, Saurabh, to answer, right, normally, we don't give guidance or outlook. I don't want to give \n",
      "you an indication, but I do want to tell you the intention on how we operate now. The mindset \n",
      "is to be operating in a controlled manner. Controlled means what I mean is that drive productivity \n",
      "as much as possible, make those investments in people, branches and technology where it is \n",
      "required and where we are able to see opportunity space.  \n",
      "Page 15 of 19 \\n \\n \n",
      "So, there is no one predetermined path, but the underlying kind of directives that, I mean, Sashi \n",
      "is sitting here, what is given is that be circumspect and much more stringent in terms of how we \n",
      "allocate cost, how we give for spending. So, we're trying to keep it as tight as we can. \n",
      "Sashidhar Jagdishan: Yes. That's right. And in fact, it doesn't mean that we will not be investing. We will be investing \n",
      "in distribution, in people, in technology. But there will be overall, we would want to ensure that \n",
      "we get productivity gains out of this. So, we all believe that our business growth is going to be \n",
      "in line with the system growth next year. \n",

      "arising out of the cost. \n",
      "Moderator: The next question is from the line of Abhishek Murarka from HSBC. \n",
      "Abhishek Murarka: My question is on this emerging corporate group. On last 4 to 5 quarters, the loan book has been \n",
      "very, very stable, not growing much. Is it that you still see risk there? Is it a function of \n",
      "profitability? Or why or when do we see some growth coming out of that book? So, if you can \n",
      "share some qualitative commentary on that, that would be useful. \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. Lovely. Abhishek, as the name suggests these are emerging corporates. That means they \n",
      "are growing and getting to be larger corporate size. Like the way we have seen spreads tighten \n",
      "in the larger corporate space. Here also, we see the spreads tightening, right? And that is \n",
      "something that we've been pretty cautious. The quality of the book is exceedingly good, right? \n",
      "Like the way the corporate book, you'll see that we have seen that we reported that too quiet \n",
      "very good. \n",
      "However, we are circumspect in terms of offering the right price. That's what is determined. We \n",
      "do want that relationship with those customers, which means there are certain level of wallet \n",
      "share that we want. We'll continue to keep those level of wallet share. And at any price, we don't \n",
      "need to keep increasing the wallet share. \n",
      "So that's how we have looked at it, of course, there is no one answer that we can do at every \n",
      "quarter time period, but we continuously evaluate and this is how we are approaching, right \n",
      "price, keep the wallet share and manage through the relationship because we do want the SME \n",
      "relationship and the individual relationships coming from these corporates. \n",
      "Abhishek Murarka: Okay. So, it's more a function of pricing rather than slippage or asset quality or risk? \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: That's absolutely correct, yes. Because all of those corporates are quite strong for us and across \n",
      "the industry, we see this quite strong. \n",
      "Sashidhar Jagdishan: Just to reiterate, Abhishek, Srini did allude to it. The asset quality across retail, unsecured, \n",
      "commercial and corporate has been very stable, including your emerging corporates. So, we \n",
      "have been seeing this for quite some time, and the stability continues even as we speak.  \n",

      "Abhishek Murarka: Sure, Sashi. I really appreciate that. And actually, a pretty commendable job there. Just one data \n",
      "keeping question. For the CRB book, what would be the blended yield? \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: We've not published that separately, but I don't know whether in our 20-F annual filings that we \n",
      "do know. So, we don't particularly break up. We have retail wholesale segment rather than 3 \n",
      "segments, yes. \n",
      "Abhishek Murarka: Yes. So, would it be higher, lower than blended book yield? Just the qualitative indication, that \n",
      "will also help. \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: We haven't published that, Abhishek. That is all. At some point in time, we'll consider... \n",
      " We'll consider doing that, yes. \n",
      "Moderator: The next question is from the line of Prakhar Sharma from Jefferies India. \n",
      "Prakhar Sharma: Congratulations on managing good results in a tough environment. I had just a few questions on \n",
      "the agri part and request you to probably even if you want to give a monosyllable answer, that \n",
      "will work. So, first part is, in this quarter, what sort of interest income reversal could have been \n",
      "there? So, has there been a few basis points impact on margins because of the seasonality? \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: There will be, and it could be INR1 billion to INR1.5 billion or so. But that's part of the business \n",
      "as usual, every other quarter, we get it, and it moves up and down, yes. \n",
      "Prakhar Sharma: Got it. And you have in this quarter versus, I think, even the first quarter, there is a reasonable \n",
      "increase in the agri slippages. So, is this also a seasonal pattern that 3Q agri slippages tend be \n",
      "higher than the 1Q slippages? Or is there a deterioration in the environment? And is it linked to \n",
      "micro finance? \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: It is slightly higher. Normally, December is slightly higher than the June. But it is within normal, \n",
      "but nothing connected with micro finance or anything. Our micro finance is a separate book, and \n",
      "that book micro finance book is less than 1% of our total book. And we have 5% of our \n",
      "workforce. There's more good social and a very stable book, well performing, lend to women in \n",
      "the rural area, handheld by our relationship managers to get them to produce various articles. \n",
      "So, we are quite proud of the book and performance of the book. \n",
      "Prakhar Sharma: Awesome. And why do you keep a lower coverage on the agri loans? Because I thought this is \n",
      "unsecured or a difficult market. Is it secured in that sense? \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: Yes, it will be. It will be. And the entry level, you know that the agri provision will be lower \n",
      "than the 70% or so. The first bucket... \n",
      "Prakhar Sharma: The LGD is also lower. Is that what you're trying to say, the LGD on this book is lower than the \n",
      "rest of the book?  \n",
      "Page 17 of 19 \\n \\n \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: So, the loss given default will be, over the lifetime, yes, it will be. If you go through an ECL \n",
      "model, it will be far lower. \n",
      "Prakhar Sharma: Got it. Got it. And last part is the agri slippages, as you report and the agri loans that you report, \n",
      "are they like-to-like or they are different cuts? \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: They are like-to-like. \n",
      "Moderator: Next question is from the line of Rahul Jain from Goldman Sachs. \n",
      "Rahul Jain: I just had 2, 3 questions. So, first is, you've got this business banking portfolio, which is INR3.5-\n",
      "odd trillion. Is it possible to get some more colour on this book? What proportion would be to \n",

      "Bhavin Lakhpatwala: The smaller book... \n",
      "Sashidhar Jagdishan: Yes, which is very stable. \n",
      "Rahul Jain: And that's used for the business purposes? \n",
      "Sashidhar Jagdishan: That is correct. \n",
      "Rahul Jain: Self-employed. Okay. How much will that be, Sashi? Have you given that number out? \n",
      "Sashidhar Jagdishan: Part of the overall portfolio, there's no change that we have seen there. \n",
      "Rahul Jain: Which one? \n",
      "Sashidhar Jagdishan: The individual business. \n",
      "Rahul Jain: Fair enough. Okay. Got it. The second was around on CASA. I appreciate the feedback or the \n",
      "response that you gave, Srini, about the choice of relationship that the business leaders are \n",
      "deciding. But at the same time, this is adding up to the cost of funds. So, if you are losing the \n",
      "proportion there, are we able to pass on to the borrowers in the same magnitude, that is, are we \n",
      "able to protect our spreads for the change of mix that is happening at the deposit level?  \n",
      "Page 18 of 19 \\n \\n \n",
      "Because I know it is specific to HDFC Bank. It's a system-wide phenomenon. But this ratio has \n",
      "been continuously under pressure, may not or may take time to bottom out until such time, \n",
      "whatever incremental lending are we doing, are we able to pass on that incremental cost to those \n",
      "borrowers on a like-to-like basis? \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. Rahul, the short answer is, yes, you can't pass it on because if it's a retail customer, it \n",
      "tends to get into adverse selection, and the nonretail customer is extremely sensitive and actually \n",
      "the spreads are tightening. It's moving on the other direction. You see the bond spreads in this \n",
      "quarter. The bond spreads have come off AAA or AA, or whatever category NBFC corporates. \n",
      "If you see anywhere between 10 to 25 basis points, the spreads have tightened in the market in \n",
      "this quarter, in the recent time period. \n",
      "So, the possibility of pass on, we wish, but that is not. Other than getting any adverse selection, \n",
      "we are very cautious. And you don't pass our credit even as the frontline goes down to different \n",
      "customer segments. So that's in terms of the lending as such... \n",
      "Rahul Jain: How do we protect the margins on a go-forward basis? How would the margins trend? Of course, \n",
      "I understand the repricing of the HDFC limited borrowing will be taking place. But just keeping \n",
      "that aside, what is the drift of spreads or the margins envisage in a declining CASA environment \n",
      "from these levels? \n",
      "Sashidhar Jagdishan: So, Rahul, good question. We have seen it over 30 years how the composition of our deposit \n",
      "mix changes with different interest rate cycles. So, in a high interest rate cycle, obviously, the \n",
      "CASA ratio is down. And as we expect in a couple of years, the economy trying to move \n",
      "northwards. We should see rates coming off. We should see the CASA volumes moving up, \n",
      "people or the TD volumes coming down, TD rates cooling off, and there's a huge correlation to \n",
      "that and the CASA volumes in the system itself. \n",
      "So, we should start to gain share, better incremental share because ultimately, some of us in the \n",
      "banking system have a customer segment, which is primarily the middle and upper middle \n",
      "income segment, including all in this call. I mean, all the fraternity in this call of 875 participants \n",
      "in the call, including in the room, that we are all sitting, all of us depict very similar consumer \n",
      "behaviour in terms of trying to either move our funds to better yielding alternative assets or lock \n",
      "it into higher TDs with the expectation that TD rates will cool off. \n",
      "So therefore, at least if that's a segment we have been very consistently focusing, the \n",
      "accentuation or the deceleration of CASA ratio will be slightly sharper for us, and that is exactly \n",
      "what we're seeing. As Srini mentioned, it doesn't mean that we sort of say no to our customer \n",
      "segment saying that, sorry, we don't want to take deposits because it's not helping our CASA \n",
      "ratio. That's not how we do. \n",
      "We offer all our products. And as it happens, it seems to be more or less we match ourselves \n",
      "with some of the large peer group banks. And so, we do operate, we are happy to take it even \n",
      "though there may be a slight deterioration of this. But these are very cyclical, and this in the \n",
      "medium to long term will normalize.  \n",
      "Page 19 of 19 \\n \\n \n",
      "And as I said, you will see a kind of an uplift the moment you see the rate cycle changing. And \n",
      "of course, it doesn't happen very coincidentally. There will be a little bit of a lag effect. But \n",
      "definitely, there will be better CASA ratios coming off in the next couple of years as well. And \n",
      "that should see bounce back into the margin uptake that all of us, including yourself, have been \n",
      "looking for. \n",
      "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: In the meantime, we do add customers 1.9 million liability relationship to get that new account \n",
      "value, 96.7 million customer relationships. We'll continue to focus on that to bring the new \n",
      "account. \n",
      "Rahul Jain: Very helpful. Just one more question. When you look at the employee headcount that went up \n",
      "in this quarter sequentially branches on a Y-o-Y basis, as we said, 1,000, credit card market, \n",
      "share seems to be inching higher. So, it seems the bank is getting ready to tap into the growth \n",
      "opportunities. LDR is down to 98. \n",
      "So, at what stage, Sashi, Srini, would you start to accelerate the pedal, you'll see that, okay, fine \n",
      "LDR is now well within the range that you wanted it to. But sequentially, the growth can start \n",
      "now coming through at what stage can we start the bank to get into the growth path more on a \n",
      "sequential basis, quarter-on-quarter basis from these levels? \n",
      "Sashidhar Jagdishan: I think whatever we had committed, in fact, if I remember, it was in the call with you, which we \n",
      "sort of shared it with the world at large, and that is the kind of commitment that we continue to \n",
      "maintain. We are on track, as I have mentioned in the opening message that whatever we are \n",
      "seeing is in light of the call that we have taken at that point in time. So, you will see this. In \n",
      "FY'26, you would see a step-up. In FY'27, you will see a further step-up. I mean I do not know \n",
      "which quarter. \n",
      "Obviously, we have the ammunition ready in terms of capital, in terms of liquidity through a \n",
      "high LCR, and we continue to outpace deposit growth as we speak. So, I don't think that should \n",
      "be a constraint as if there is an opportunity for the economy to change positively and the outlook \n",
      "getting better and the interest rates coming off, I think we should sort of see a bit of a step-up \n",

As a reminder, all participant lines will be in the listen-only mode and there will be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes. Should you need assistance during this conference call, please signal an operator by pressing star then zero on your touchtone phone. Please note that this conference is being recorded.\\n\\nI now hand the conference over to Mr. Srinivasan Vaidyanathan, Chief Financial Officer, HDFC Bank. Thank you, and over to you, sir.\\n\\nOkay. Thank you. Good evening, and welcome to all. We have with us Sashi Jagdishan, MD, and CEO. We'll request him to give some opening remarks before we can jump in. Sashi, over to you for any remarks that you have.\\n\\nThank you Srini and thank you all for joining in on a Saturday evening. You probably would have seen the press release and the investor presentation that the team would have put it up. So let me give you a very brief context as to how we have done on a broad basis before Srini takes over some of the finer points. Within the global context, we believe India is well placed. RBI has recently commenced cutting rates.\\n\\nThe moderation in food inflation and headline inflation also augurs well. We've already seen 2 rate cuts and the change in stance from neutral to accommodative is a welcome relief to all of us. RBI intends to increase durable liquidity, which is followed by concrete actions, which, along with rate cuts, will help supporting the GDP growth. For FY '26, we expect the GDP to be supported by a pickup in rural spending, discretionary consumer demand and investment activity.\\n\\nOf course, the goods exports may be impacted until the global trade and tariff situation becomes far more clearer. We acknowledge that the global macroeconomic outlook has become more uncertain due to the recent trade tariff-related measures and the volatility surrounding them. This may potentially impact global inflation leading to lower growth across economies.\\n\\nCorporates have adopted a wait-and-watch stance, and we are waiting for more clarity. We remain watchful. Coming to the bank. As you recall, we spelled it out in Q4 of last year and to be more precise, I think, somewhere around February.\\n\\nWe continue to be on the journey that we spelled out. Our credit deposit ratio has been brought down from the highs at the time of merger, which was at about $110 \\\\%$ to around $96 \\\\%$ as of March 2025. Our deposits have grown faster than the system and so has it grown faster than our loans as well.\\n\\nNext year, in line with what we had committed, the adjustment in CD ratio will not be so steep, supporting the loan growth for the bank, but it will be on a downward path. Cost remains under a tight leash, and we expect this to continue. Asset quality one of our USPs, remains pristine.\\n\\nAs liquidity and growth improve, we are well placed to grow in both assets and deposits. We have been doing a lot of work on technology over the last few years and we should start reaping the benefits of the same gradually during the course of the year. This is a space to watch out for, and we shall unveil at the appropriate time.\",\n",

Thank you so much.\\n\\nSrini, over to you.\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. Thank you, Sashi, for those remarks. With that, we can open it up, and we'll use the time for questions. Please go ahead whoever is on the queue, please.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nChintan Joshi:\\n\\nThank you very much sir. We'll take a first question from the line of Chintan Joshi from Autonomous. Please go ahead.\\n\\nHi, good evening. Can I start with NIM? Some expansion coming through this quarter, if you could explain what the drivers of that expansion was? And also how we can think about NIMs progressing over the next year? On one hand, you've got the rate cuts, but on the other hand, your funding synergies are gradually coming through. Do you think if you see 100 bps rate cycle, NIMs can be higher than where we are today?\\n\\nThat's on NIMs. And then the second question I have is more on the corporate sector. If I look at cash and investments on corporate sector balance sheet over the last 3, 4 years and how they park it in the banking system that's kind of gone up significantly. But these deposits are short term in nature, we don't have the LCR benefit like we have with the household sector, how does the bank take on these deposits? How do they use it?\\n\\nI assume they can't really be used for term lending. It would be helpful to understand in this period where we've got geopolitical uncertainty, there will be even more corporate deposits, how does the banking system or yourselves use that?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. Two things. One is at the macro level. First, I'll take the NIM first. You saw the NIM for us over the last 12 months if you see, operated in a very narrow band, 3.4 to 3.5. Last year, March quarter was 3.44; now on a core basis, 3.46; last quarter was 3.43 and so on, so it's in a very narrow band plus/minus 5 basis points here and there, that's where the NIM has operated. And if you look at the components of the NIM, one is the cost of funds, which is in one of our pages where we published that, which is I think is on Page number 15, I think it is in our deck.\\n\\nThe cost of funds is also very stable at about 4.9. And there are two things going on in the cost of funds to be stable there. One is the borrowing mix has come down during this time period, whatever is on the page there, you see that the borrowing mix in the first of the time period, December ' 23 was $21 \\\\%$ and then from then on last March, it was $18 \\\\%$ and now it is $14 \\\\%$ borrowing mix. So that's one of the tailwind that contributed as a positive item to the cost of funds.\\n\\nThen there is a headwind in the cost of funds we have seen is the customer preference towards time deposit. If you see the rate of growth even in the recent time period, time deposit rate of growth, INR2 trillion in a full year time period. In the quarter, this quarter, recent quarter, about INR0.8 trillion time deposit rate of growth, 20\\\\%-or-so, right? So we have seen that.\",\n",

       "   'markdown': \"So the CASA ratio mix has not been favorable. It's an adverse variance there, right? But between all of these, the cost of funds, we kept it stable by selecting retail deposits and not pricing up on the nonretail deposits, and we'll come to the second aspect of what you asked.\\n\\nSo the nonretail we've been circumspect, even I think it's going back to almost December '23, that time period itself, we saw that the pricing on the nonretail deposit was unacceptably high and competitive without consideration for the liquidity lendable value of those deposits. So we remain circumspect and didn't price, but try to manage it in a way that it's in a very narrow band there.\\n\\nNow come to the yield on assets, the other component of the NIM before we get to the conclusion of what you'd asked. So if you look at the yield on assets, they've also been pretty stable between $8.3 \\\\%, 8.4 \\\\%$ that's the level at which we operated and that's how we manage that.\\n\\nNow yield on assets if you see here, the retail will give more yield than the nonretail because then you'll have to pay through credit cost in some manner now or at some point in time. But we have had a balanced growth there to manage this yield in a very stable band there.\\n\\nAnd again selection, we have seen over the last 12 months, 18 months, the corporate loans of the larger ticket corporate loans and the larger ticket SME loans, have been very competitive, particularly coming from certain public sector institutions where the growth is an objective and not necessarily margin or returns, we have seen that pricing is very, very low on those.\\n\\nI mean the loan spreads have been very low compared to the bond spreads. That means when the bond spreads moves up or down, the loan spreads is not moving, it's actually coming down, which is what we are seeing. Now we try to manage it through appropriate selection, both -- quality is, of course, the first criteria for selection. Quality passes, it has to pass the rate and if it doesn't passes, we were happy to let go and not necessarily bulk up the balance sheet because we said we can reposition the balance sheet and grow the loans at any time. So that's how we manage that.\\n\\nNow coming to what's happened in the recent time period; 3, 4 basis points always moves at any time for various reasons. So there's no one particular one we can say. Of course, there is a cash reserve ratio that changed sometime in December. So there was some positive impact last quarter and the balance of the positive impact in this quarter, call it, a couple of basis points.\\n\\nAnd then a few basis points moves up and down. There is no kind of a finesse. And similarly, when the NPA changes, lower agriculture in the March quarter that also is a good kind of a margin benefit you get to some extent, but they're all within a narrow band.\\n\\nNow where does it go? I don't want to provide an outlook where this goes. But all I want to tell you is that I described to you this long to tell you how we think about margin and how we manage, which is policy rates change, so the loans that are linked to policy rates like the repo rate gets changed right away, so which is a headwind.\\n\\nAnd the faster the policy rate changes, it starts to factor in faster. The deposit side or the funding side rates take time to factor it in. So I would urge not to look at quarter-to-quarter because it's not something that could be managed at all because the policy can change tomorrow and then the deposit rates can change over time.\",\n",

       "   'markdown': \"So you have to look at it at least a year or longer than a year to see how stable and how we are managing that margin level, which is what on the page that you are seeing shows that Page 15 at that kind of a level stability how it gets managed. That's the first part. The second part is you talked about the cash and investment and the corporate sector balance sheet, how it gets deployed.\\n\\nAgain, the first part I tried to answer that certain categories of deposits have lower lendable value and the market doesn't price appropriately for that lendable value because that's how it should be. Typically, those kind of segmented deposits should be lower than a retail because the retail is the highest lendable value you can get. But these type of deposits are priced far higher than the retail deposits. So thereby only for large relationships, and where we could get certain other product mix aligned well, we patronize and participate.\\n\\nAnd there are certain other institutions like affiliated institutions to large corporates that we patronize and hold it. That's because we want to keep the wallet share on our lending. We are the largest working capital bank in the country, so we want to keep that wallet share growing in a reasonable manner. So we participate to some extent on these. Otherwise, we don't bid for these kind of deposits.\\n\\nModerator: $\\\\quad$ Thank you. We'll take the next question from the line of Mahrukh Adajania from Nuvama. Please go ahead.\\n\\nMahrukh Adajania: Good evening and congratulations. I had two questions. The first one is on deposit growth. So large banks have cut deposit rates in the most popular buckets by 30 to 45 bps , which is of course transmission, but are you comfortable that the liquidity position has changed enough to support a healthy deposit growth for the system and yourself? Because tight liquidity was really a big issue for the last 1.5 years, except in the last 2 to 3 months. So that's my first question.\\n\\nAnd my second question is on your priority progress. Of course, your CRB has been growing faster than your other loans. But if at all there are any shortfalls, how would that be managed? Would that have any ROA impact, so just a focused discussion on how priority will be managed?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. First is if I get on the rates and deposits as such, right? One is that it's not -- the deposit rate change, if you noticed, while we may have had gone first or second or whatever it is, across the industry, you're seeing -- at least the large top 3, 5 players you are seeing responded to the policy rate change. So that's something that was part of the transmission process.\\n\\nThe loan transmission for good amount happens automatically because of the linked to policy rates. And on the deposit side, one has to manage it and announce it after deliberation. So you have seen that happen. So there is no change as such from a competitive positioning or whatever.\\n\\nAll that differentiates with that ability to reach, that means have the distribution reach, bring in new customers, have better engagement through the RMs, that's been what we have done in the past, that's how we have grown, if you see the past year, rate of deposit growth about 15.8\\\\%-orso, that's INR3.4 trillion in the year. So we continue to be optimistic and continue to have that approach of energy to get that market share gaining, right?\",\n",

       "   'markdown': \"So the rate is not a differentiator in the past, and we don't think rate is a differentiator to win something because that would be very transitional and a short-term approach to getting that. So that's one on deposits, right? We continue to be playing on an even field there, and we're confident of how we are positioned for that. Second aspect of what you asked is the priority sector lending.\\n\\nWhile the priority sector details get published in the annual report, but nevertheless, at an aggregate level, as we have said in the past, we do meet that $40 \\\\%$ that is required. We're slightly above that level in terms of the aggregate priority sector lending. There are two sub-segments, which is the small and marginal farmer segment and a weaker section that always calls for something that inorganically, that means how do we go and buy it in the market either through certificates, IBPC, PTCs or any other manner or through on-lending program.\\n\\nThere are several instruments that we use and we keep on. And if none of those economics work well, there is always the last resort is the RIDF. That's not our first -- if you don't get any of these done, then there is RIDF, right? If you look at the cost dynamics of any of these things, they all work almost very similar dynamics to the overall P\\\\&L. You rightfully so touched up on returns. What does it mean to returns? Whether you have one or the other instrument, the impact on the return is very similar, there's no difference. And that is what historically also we have done.\\n\\nEven if you look at the year that has gone by, we were about $1 \\\\%$-or-so short on these kind of segments. And even now, we continue to look for and search for how to close in that last $1 \\\\%$ across SMF for the weaker and we will endeavor to do and close as much as we can. If not, the alternatives are already there, yes.\\n\\nMahrukh Adajania: Okay, perfect. Thank you.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nAnand Swaminathan:\\n\\nI have a couple of questions. Sashi, first question is on CRB. There has been a lot of media noise around senior management and some changes. It would be great if you could give us some confidence around what's happening and give us some clarity around that?\\n\\nThat's number one. And number two, on ROAs. We have successfully defended the $1.8 \\\\%$ ROA we've been guiding for the last several quarters. Srini, as we go into the rate cut cycle and growth slightly improving in the FY '26, do we have enough levers to defend this $1.8 \\\\%$ level or we should expect a brief kind of decline and then come back above $1.8 \\\\%$ when growth eventually recovers?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. I'm going to get it started first in terms of what it is, right? See, if you see, we had a reorganization. And Rahul Shukla who heads the commercial and rural banking had taken personal time off and is on sabbatical, right? So he's taken some time off or whatever, family reasons and so on. And the reorganization is expected to accomplish a few things, right?\\n\\nOne is, if you see what is going on particularly in the rural segment, take -- example, I'll give you the -- how we are thinking about to drive certain synergy and capture the growth opportunity and bring some productivity, right?\",\n",

       "   'markdown': \"So that's both from a customer point of view, better engagement; and from people point of view, better productivity and what does it do to get that. One is, simple thing, if you take about agriculture, that's now part of the retail management team who handled the two-wheeler and auto business and so on, that's the same kind of a leadership that handles agriculture. So once we reach the farmer, you know that as part of the prior growth approach, we expanded our geographical reach to 2.25 lakh -- 225,000 villages.\\n\\nNow the next phase of this growth is having a presence there, we need to go capture the volumes, that is reach out in the vicinity of those villages the right kind of farmer to bring in. So right now, we envisage not to just do an agriculture loan because that particular town, that farmer, that family and the neighbors do need a 2 -wheeler, do need a car, auto loan and so on and so forth.\\n\\nSo under the same team that we are trying to get these kind of multiple products made available to them. And also, if you look at where this particular thing is positioned, it's also positioned alongside the gold loan business. You know that in the country, a lot of farmers have gold and use gold for financing appropriately and perhaps rightfully so to fund the requirements of the farm.\\n\\nAnd so now these synergies are expected. And what does it do? It enables us to have a frequent connect with that farmer and that community in the rural segment through these kind of products which we are having. So it enhances our periodicity at which we will touch that customer. And so since we are delivering multiple products to the same customer, we do anticipate this is supposed to give better people productivity.\\n\\nSo I gave you one example, and that's how if you look at anything, all of those things that we have done is expected to provide the significant lift in productivity across all of these product and geography and customer segments that we are operating. So that's one, I hope, that gives you the context of the CRB, what goes on...\\n\\nSashidhar Jagdishan:\\n\\nSrini, I would like to add to whatever you have said. Rahul was one of our very good business managers. And obviously, he did express, as Srini mentioned, his desire to go on a sabbatical because he had some personal matters to attend to with his family and the academics of his children.\\n\\nBut having said that, he built a very strong team. And as you probably heard Srini, we have reorganized the entire asset side of the balance sheet under an even more abler individual. As you know, Kaizad now handles the entire asset side of the balance sheet and the investment banking business. And all the heads who have been with us, we have, as we have mentioned several times in the past, we have a very good depth in management and they now all of them have now handle larger businesses and report to the Deputy Managing Director.\\n\\nI'm quite excited about this reorganization, and I'm sure that we will harness the most optimal way to find growth and as Srini mentioned, synergies between various asset groups so that we can optimize even our resources at the grassroots levels, so that there is not too much of an overlap. So this is going to be a very exciting period for us, and you will start to see a lot more efficiencies and even greater hunger than what we have seen from the CRB and the entire asset side of the balance sheet.\",\n",

So this is a year to watch out for in terms of the kind of benefits that will accrue from this so-called massive reorganization that we have undertaken during the year. Yes, Srini, over to you.\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: Yes. Thank you for that additional color. Very good. Now getting to your second aspect of ROA. See, if you see our ROA has operated around that 1.9 level, right, plus/minus a few basis points. Ever since we accomplished the merger July 1, 2023, it's been approximately around that level, right? We're consistently delivering there.\\n\\nWhen you had asked about what does it do in a different rate scenario, if whatever happens? I talked about the margin in a couple of questions before in terms of how we think about the margin to be within a stable range, right? So ROA similarly can move around 5, 10 basis points.\\n\\nOur long-term average of ROA, if you see, somewhere, I think we have published that also. Over a 10-year, 15-year period, if you see, anywhere between a merger or pre-merger or post-merger, any which way if you look at it, 1.9 to 2.1 .\\n\\nAnd for many instances, the frequency of two is the highest. And sometimes we'd had 1.9 and sometimes we'd 2.1. So that is the optimal level, right, at which it operates. If the ROA tends for better cost of credit or better margin that comes through and for cost efficiency and so on, to some extent, there is always a reinvestment opportunity because at the end of the day, our market share on deposits is 11 .\\n\\nOur market share on distribution, which is branches is $6 \\\\%$ and our market share on loans is $14 \\\\%$. So we still have enormous room and a need to make investments, pace those investments appropriately to keep growing for the long term. So that's in that narrow band that we operate. So there is no one particular -- can we have a 10 basis points change in a year possible? Absolutely possible. But can it be far higher than that? Not likely, right? Because we have operated in a stable band up or down.\\n\\nModerator: Thank you.\\n\\nAnand Swaminathan: Thank you Srini. That is very useful. Just a quick follow-up...\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nRikin Shah:\\n\\nI request you to join back the queue for follow-up question, please, as we have other participants waiting for their turn. Thank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Rikin Shah from IIFL. Please go ahead.\\n\\nThank you for the opportunity. Two quick questions. First one for the repo-link loans. Do they get repriced immediately as soon as the repo rate changes? Or is there usually a lag of a few months from the change of repo rate? And secondly, an extension to this, does the number of days impact your reported margins? That's the first question. And the second one is, was there any reversal on AIF provisions in this quarter? Those are my two questions.\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. So in terms of the timing of the repo rate change and so thereby the transmission or flowthrough, by product, it is different. If you think about mortgages, which is $30 \\\\%$ of the book-or-so,\",\n",

       "   'markdown': \"it can happen in the immediate cycle, rate changes and in the following month cycle, it can happen. So it can be anywhere within a month, it can happen. If you look at corporate loan or something, it can happen immediately.\\n\\nSo it depends on product to product and the contractual arrangements, which are there in terms of the repricing frequency. But no -- it will not be a kind of an annual or something like that. It can be a month, it can be a quarter, but not something that it takes a year to get that transmitted. And your second aspect of number of days, yes, it can be a couple of basis points, it happens all the time. And yes, that's possible.\\n\\nRikin Shah: Got it. And the reversal of AIF provision, please?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: AIF, there's nothing significant in this quarter in terms of the contingency. If you remember the AIF provision that we had last financial year, not the one that ended, was about INR1,200 croresor-so. Then after the RBI clarification in the beginning of the recent financial year, it was taken down. And then depending on the volumes that move up and down, it moves, but there's nothing significant as such on that, yes.\\n\\nRikin Shah: Okay. The context of this question, Srini, was that in Note number 15 to your results, it says that AIF-related provision stock is around INR288 crores right now. The last quarter, it read around INR350 crores. So I just wanted to clarify, was there any reversal or just some of the AIF investments matured and hence, you were not required to carry them?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: So yes, it was not required, but then it didn't survive to the P\\\\&L to the bottom because there are so many ins and outs that happens in the provision. So the way of contingent provision didn't happen because at the end, there was some net addition of INR60 crores for various other reasons. So it didn't survive to the P\\\\&L to the bottom line, yes.\\n\\nRikin Shah: Understood. Thank you very much.\\n\\nModerator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Kunal Shah from Citigroup. Please go ahead.\\n\\nKunal Shah: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. A couple of questions. So firstly, again, sorry to harp again on margins. But the way you have been indicating the balance sheet construct is such that we should be able to operate margins within a narrow band, does that really change with the relatively higher repo rate cut? Or do we have additional levers to still manage margins relatively better compared to that of peers?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: Yes. That's a good question, Kunal. Thanks for asking that. One is that when the policy rate changes in a steady manner over a longer period of time, you know that the adjustment that is required from a cost of funds catches up to neutralize -- to keep the margin safe. But if in quick succession the policy rate changes, then the matching of the cost of funds takes longer time. So that means you cannot look at whether it is in a narrow band in a quarter-to-quarter period. But when you look at a year, you will be able to see that it is in a very narrow band.\",\n",

       "   'markdown': \"Kunal Shah:\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan:\\n\\nKunal Shah:\\n\\nSure. So on CASA, we have been indicating that in the falling interest rate cycle, generally, we would tend to improve the CASA, but the rate action both on the savings as well as FD seems to be almost similar or savings is relatively higher, then would it be fair to assume that maybe the overall structurally declining SA that phase can very much continue?\\n\\nAnd maybe a follow-up on the LDR. When you indicated that now LDR we will not see a steep decline, are we changing a stance that we need to get it to the premerger level at an accelerated pace and maybe even if it holds relatively higher at 90,92 , we would be comfortable then over the next 18,24 months?\\n\\nOkay. First is the CASA. I do want to go back to describing that, right? The empirical study, both industry as well as for us, which is published CASA ratio and the policy rates if you see over a 15 year period through the up and down rate cycle, the CASA has moved in the opposite direction, which is when the rate goes up, CASA ratio goes down; and the rate starts to come down, there is some lag. It's not instantaneous. A few quarters lag, the CASA starts to go up.\\n\\nSo you'll see that if you map us over a 15 -year period and the industry, you'll see that it moves up and down. So we do -- if the empirical is repeated, there is no reason to believe that it would not be the same or we're not seeing something different as such, we should get the CASA back, but not in a hurry, right? Because there have been 2 rate cuts that have happened. We need to wait and see how this stabilizes, what the global macro effects, what it plays in the country, both from an inflation cost and purchasing power of people.\\n\\nWe need to see how all of those plays out, which you have seen in the last 12, 18 months that middle to the lower segment did not have adequate disposable income to be put in savings because they were using it for their day-to-day needs. So that's why you saw CASA had one more nuance to it that it came down, right? People had less to save. They were spending on certain things and money was moving from household to non-household and so on and so forth. So that's in terms of the CASA as such.\\n\\nAnd LDR?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: LDR, I'll take a shot at it to see. See, what we had described, Kunal, last quarter or even about a year ago is that the LDR will come down to the premerger level, 85 to 90 ; more precisely, it was 87 -and-change the quarter before the merger, 85 to 90 is what we have operated, that will come into that range in FY '27.\\n\\nSo that is why we saw that the loan growth in this year that went by, FY '25, will be lower than the prior year for the industry and we took that opportunity, both industry loan growth going down and pricing being not to our liking, we accelerated to say, let's take this opportunity to slow down even further. So we grew at $7.7 \\\\%$, the assets under management in this recent time period.\\n\\nWe have also indicated that in FY '26, we are subject to appropriate pricing, quality is always given, appropriate pricing that we will be growing at the market rate of growth. If you see the recent quarter that went by, March quarter ' 25 , our sequential momentum growth was about $3.3 \\\\%$, which call it approximately annualized $12 \\\\%$ or $13 \\\\%$ thereabout.\",\n",

So we do expect that FY ' 27 is when it will come below that 90 mark. So at this moment, there is no other approach that we are having. And we continue to power on getting the right kind of deposits at the right price to keep that leadership position and gaining market share on deposits.\\n\\nModerator: We'll take our next question from the line of Abhishek M. from HSBC.\\n\\nAbhishek M.: So a couple of very quick clarifications and then one question. The first is when you say repo cut gets passed on right away, does it happen exactly right away or does it happen on a particular day in a month or a particular day in a quarter? When does the transmission actually happen?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: It can happen -- if your repricing date is set for 15th, it is 15th. If Bhavin's reset date is set for 25th, it is 25 th. If my reset date is 5 th, it is 5 th. And it depends product to product. And that means the mortgage product is different. Wholesale product is different. SME product is different. So it is different product. There's no one that is what it's broadly. Will a good amount reprice in a month? Yes. Will most of it reprice in 3 months? Absolutely.\\n\\nAbhishek M.: Right. So the cumulative impact will probably be seen in Q1 may not have been seen in Q4 yet, that's the understanding, right?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: That is correct.\\n\\nAbhishek M.: Right. And then just in terms of the...\\n\\nBhavin Lakhpatwala: Abhishek, also the fact that quarter 4 -- Abhishek, the first repo rate cut happened in February itself. So even the full quarter impact of that you have not seen, you will see that only in the April to June quarter. So you'll see the full 50 basis points impact happening in this quarter, what you've not seen perhaps in the fourth quarter.\\n\\nAbhishek M.: Perfect. Yes. That's what I wanted to clarify. And therefore, in terms of the NIM trajectory, right, 1 Q would anyway not have any benefit from the TD cuts that you are taking now? So there should be a bigger impact in 1Q and then through the year, you would see some benefit of the rate cut, etcetera, that you're taking, that should build up...\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: That is correct, but I do not want to talk about it quarter-to-quarter at all. You should look at a year because we do not know what will come next week or next month, so we will handle it as a management appropriately to market needs and customer needs.\\n\\nAbhishek M.: Yes, fair enough. And therefore, in terms of this 2\\\\% ROA target, let's say, is this like now a 2-year or a 3-year kind of target? Because it will take time for cost of funds to catch up and for policy rates to maybe stabilize at some level. So does this become like a ' 27 or ' 28 kind of target for you?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: I don't want to give you an outlook. And by the way, I do not know where you picked up a target of a $2 \\\\%$ ROA. We've not specified that. All we specified even in this call earlier was that when you look at the frequency of the $2 \\\\%$ over the last 10 years or 15 years, the $2 \\\\%$ has been the maximum frequency at which we have hit on an annual basis. That's what I mentioned.\",\n",

Basically, do you have any other levers in your P\\\\&L, maybe fees or maybe opex where you could see some improvement from here?\\n\\nWe have told you about the opex, right, in terms of how we have made investments, if you think about the branch investments, and so the time for getting some realization benefits as well as the productivity benefits are on the anvil on that. If you look at a 5-year period, 250 branches to 350 branches to 750 to 1,400 -something to 900 to 700 something now. So in terms of the branches, this is the last 5, 6 years, if you see that we have built, right? Even the recent time period, 700 branches, if you see, is almost $2 x$ what we were doing 5 years ago in terms of the branch.\\n\\nSo we have accelerated and made those investments. And now we are pressing on that to get better productivity, and thereby, the efficiency to come in. Again, the trajectory of that is not quarter-toquarter, not linear, but the trajectory of that is for the cost to income to improve. And again, one other aspect I do want to tell not just look at cost to income, please look at cost to assets too, where we are the best-in-class in terms of cost to assets at about 1.9-and-change.\\n\\nAbhishek M.:\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan:\\n\\nAbhishek M:\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nHarsh Modi:\\n\\nYes, exactly. So that is why I was wondering if it can improve even further from here because you're already very efficient when you compare to your peers?\\n\\nWe are efficient, and we continue to press on new technologies and press on greater productivity, yes, indeed.\\n\\nGot it. Okay. Thank you so much and all the best.\\n\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Harsh Modi from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\\n\\nYes, hi. Thanks for allowing to ask questions. First is on CASA market share. Could you provide some details over, let's say, next 18 months to 24 months, how do you see your both CA and SA market share evolve and is there any particular number that we could think about in terms of CASA ratio, let's say, over 18 months to 24 months?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: In a different form, it's the same question of an outlook or a target that want us to specify. The opportunity exists. Our total market share is 11. The time deposit or CASA market share is give and take around that level. So which means we are evenly positioned, take time deposit could be 11.5 and CASA could be 10.5 and so somewhere in that level. That's where we are in terms of the market share.\\n\\nThe opportunity exists across both of this. I do want one other very important factor to tell and which we have been mentioning over the last 3 years, 4 years. The penetration of time deposit in our customer base is low. So we do see opportunity space for getting better customer relationship through those time deposits. So we cannot leave it on the table to say just because it is time deposit, we don't want.\\n\\nWe want that customer relationship because that's based on customer needs. So I cannot tell you that we drive to one ratio and our goal is to have this ratio and so on. Our goal is to have the predominant share, wallet share of the customer whatever comes. And so thereby, that is how it is\",\n",

Okay, I understand that, Srini. If I could rephrase the question, especially for savings account market share. Incremental savings account market share over next 18 months to 24 months given your investments in branches that you just explained and technology and best-in-class distribution network, do you expect to gain meaningful market share on savings account in next 18 to 24 month or would you probably just be maintaining your market share over the next 18 to 24 months, how do we think about that?\\n\\nOur ambition and our historical experience has always been to gain market share. That is how we are positioned. How much we gain depends on market conditions at any point in time and the disposable income in the hands of the customers, depending on how the inflation plays out, how the wage growth plays out and so on and so forth and market returns as well as is another aspect of it, yes, which we have seen in the last 12 months when the market returns were high, we have seen some investment into the markets.\\n\\nAll right. Thank you.\\n\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Param Subramanian from Investec. Please go ahead.\\n\\nHi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just a few data-keeping questions. Firstly, what is the maturity of the term deposits on book? I don't mean on sourcing, on book. And similarly how much of your borrowings mature over the course of next year?\\n\\nNo, you'll get some of these things you'll get once the annual report is out. We don't have that, some of these things handy because it belongs to multiple buckets that goes through. So on the time deposit, we can't really have a number to give out to say this is a maturity that you're looking for. And sorry the second question.\\n\\nYes, broad number would also do, Bhavin?\\n\\nNo, it's not something which we can just, I mean, difficult to put a number out that way. And sorry, can you repeat the second question again, please?\\n\\nOn borrowings over the next 12 months.\\n\\nSee, two things on borrowings. There is a maturity profile, which also last time we published, I think it's 0.5 trillion or thereabouts of the legacy bond borrowings will mature. And we will have opportunity space to have some new borrowings, which is infrastructure borrowings, which could be much more cost effective. So it depends on the market rates and there's no one particular strategy. We do the breakeven between certain category of deposits and infrastructure borrowings.\\n\\nAnd in many instances, we see the infra borrowings could be better. So again, I don't know what the market rate will be when we go to the market, but both of these are -- we will have some borrowings, infra borrowings at a cost-effective way and there will be a certain level of maturity\",\n",

       "   'markdown': \"that will happen which is, again 0.5 trillion or thereabouts, that will happen. And keep in mind that the borrowing mix to the total liabilities now stands at about $14 \\\\%$.\\n\\nPremerger, it was in single digit call it $8 \\\\%$ or thereabouts $9 \\\\%$. So ideally, somewhere in the long term, it will transition towards that level. A combination of both balance sheet growth as well as some maturity and replaced modestly with cost-effective borrowings.\\n\\nParam Subramanian: Thanks Srini. Just one additional part. How much of your borrowing is, say, floating rate hedged as we go into this rate cycle, just a relevant question there. And secondly, last quarter, you had given a number on the PSL shortfall in SMF and weaker section being about $1 \\\\%$, where are we there broadly?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: About that percent-or-so is where it is. We endeavor to close it, but that is always -- we chase volumes at different categories, as I told you on that. Then your first part of the question...\\n\\nBhavin Lakhpatwala: Is borrowing that hedge? It continues to be around $60 \\\\%, 65 \\\\%$ of the borrowings, which will be hedged, which is again from the HDFC Limited book, which is what we've always had that.\\n\\nParam Subramanian: And which is the relevant floating benchmark once you look at...\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nDeekshant:\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: I guess you are talking about the industry level. You've seen us through various cycles, we've been pretty steady. Our NPAs have been quite steady other than the year or two of COVID. Even those time periods, maybe 20 basis points, it went up, but otherwise we've been operating in a very narrow band on nonperforming loans and so on. I guess your question is more philosophical in terms of what's happening in the industry and where that is heading.\\n\\nIf you listen to our Chief Credit Officer, he has done various analysis to say that the credit cycle bottomed out maybe even three quarters ago, four quarters ago and which you have seen at the industry level, the nonperforming loans going up and the credit cost beginning to go up. The offset has always been some of the legacy loans 5 years, 10 years, whatever legacy loans some recoveries and repayments have happened against those.\\n\\nSo you don't necessarily see the full effect of that through the P\\\\&L at the industry level. You don't see that. So whether the credit NPAs and credit costs will normalize over the next 1 year, 3 years, it should, but that should be at a lower level than what historically we have seen is the assessment of our credit officers.\",\n",

Our segmentation of customers, whether it's corporate, whether it's SME, whether it is retail is very clear. We have tested these segments over a long period of time and we probably have a reasonable fix on the expected loss, credit losses in that. And the opportunity to nibble away more share in these kind of customer segments is huge.\\n\\nAs I said, it is up to us the pace at which we want to grow, but it doesn't mean that the proportion of our losses is going to go up just because we are growing fast because we're going to be limiting ourselves only to the segment that we are comfortable to operate.\\n\\nSo Srini did allude to it. If you take a 25 -year history of our expect actual credit loss experience adjusted for some of the event risk and also mergers, you will find that we have been virtually on a flat basis or on a straight-line basis across the X axis of the curve.\\n\\nSo growth does not mean our losses or loss ratios will go up. I think it should be more or less in a range bound because of the target segment that we would still like to -- because there is opportunity, there's a runway, and we would want to stick to this opportunity and not go down the risk ladders.\\n\\nSir, there is no question that we are the best-in-class when it comes to like loan performances and even the way that we issue the loans. Just to like narrow this question a little bit more: There seems to be an early sign of some sort of SME growth that can come in. Sir, also alluded to that some of the things have bottomed out right now.\\n\\nConsidering that SME growth does come in and even the retail loans do start coming in better, namely the home loans, do we think that the incremental growth of market share that we are focusing on will that come at the cost which would be lower on the lower end of our range of our NPA cycle or would that be at a higher end of the range of NPA cycle?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: So getting directly to that question in terms of whether we would go down the credit ladder to pick up the volumes? The short answer is no. Credit policies will not be changed to pick up volumes. They have been stable and they're consistent. And the market opportunity presents very well to capture.\\n\\nIn addition to the credit, one other important dimension that determines whether we pick up that loan or not is also the rate at which we can do. And the third dimension that is required is we just not want to be a lending institution to anybody. We want it to be a relationship bank, including SME.\\n\\nWe want that proprietor or partners, their family, even if there are 5 employees or 3 employees or 50 employees, their employee account, the primary banking need to be with us. So we are not going to do lending just as a product of lending. It is for the total banking relationship we want from that particular transaction that we go into.\\n\\nOkay. Sir, just one last follow-up here...\\n\\nDeekshant, I request you to join back the queue please as we have other participants waiting.\",\n",

Firstly, I know it's early days, but have we started cutting <br> lending rates on fixed-rate products... |\\n| Moderator: | I'm sorry, Piran, your voice is breaking. |\\n| Piran Engineer: | Is it audible now operator? |\\n| Moderator: | Yes, please go ahead. Yes. |\\n| Piran Engineer: | So congrats on the quarter. My first question is, has the industry or have we started cutting lending <br> rates on fixed rate products like vehicle loans or personal loans after the 50 bps repo rate cut? |\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: See, no, I don't know, but we are not -- we are seeing intense competition. We've not seen anything different now than what we saw 6 months ago from a price competitiveness point of view, let it be mortgage product or auto product and so on. So that's one from an industry point of view. I will not be able to talk about their risk-based pricing model.\\n\\nBut for us, we have a band of risk-based pricing product. For a given risk profile what is the kind of a price band that we can operate and that has been consistent and we'll operate in the same manner there.\\n\\nPiran Engineer: Okay. So it's fair to say we've not cut lending rates like in auto loans, etc.?\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: No, we've not cut, but we do have a risk-based pricing model for us given a risk profile of a customer. So my profile may be different from my colleague's profile, and so it depends on what it is, so we get different rates.\\n\\nPiran Engineer: Okay. Fair. And sir, just secondly, on your unsecured book of roughly INR2 lakh crores, what percentage would be unsecured business loans? And can you also just talk a bit about this business, the customer profile? Are these repeat loans to existing customers? Or do you also acquire fresh new-to-bank customers through this product?\\n\\nAnd are there -- like when we have the retail asset quality cycle -- by we, I mean the industry, are there some signs of stress in unsecured business loans? Just an overview of this would be useful.\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay, yes. One you see that we published personal loans, which is almost about close to INR2 trillion or-so, right, as of the quarter end INR2 trillion or so. See call it, about $75 \\\\%, 80 \\\\%$ of them are salaried customers, mostly salaried with us or if it is taken from the market still salaried. The rest could be the open market loans, which are non-salaried customers.\\n\\nNon-salaried customers could be self-employed, which is some professionals or they're doing certain other activities and so on and so forth, which they may use this for other purposes. Then the third aspect of it is the performance of what this is. No, we've not experienced stress, touch\",\n",

As a reminder, all participant lines will be in the listen-only mode and there will be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes. Should you need assistance during this conference call, please signal an operator by pressing star then zero on your touchtone phone. Please note that this conference is being recorded.\\n\\nI now hand the conference over to Mr. Srinivasan Vaidyanathan, Chief Financial Officer, HDFC Bank. Thank you, and over to you, sir.\\n\\nOkay. Thank you. Good evening, and welcome to all. We have with us Sashi Jagdishan, MD, and CEO. We'll request him to give some opening remarks before we can jump in. Sashi, over to you for any remarks that you have.\\n\\nThank you Srini and thank you all for joining in on a Saturday evening. You probably would have seen the press release and the investor presentation that the team would have put it up. So let me give you a very brief context as to how we have done on a broad basis before Srini takes over some of the finer points. Within the global context, we believe India is well placed. RBI has recently commenced cutting rates.\\n\\nThe moderation in food inflation and headline inflation also augurs well. We've already seen 2 rate cuts and the change in stance from neutral to accommodative is a welcome relief to all of us. RBI intends to increase durable liquidity, which is followed by concrete actions, which, along with rate cuts, will help supporting the GDP growth. For FY '26, we expect the GDP to be supported by a pickup in rural spending, discretionary consumer demand and investment activity.\\n\\nOf course, the goods exports may be impacted until the global trade and tariff situation becomes far more clearer. We acknowledge that the global macroeconomic outlook has become more uncertain due to the recent trade tariff-related measures and the volatility surrounding them. This may potentially impact global inflation leading to lower growth across economies.\\n\\nCorporates have adopted a wait-and-watch stance, and we are waiting for more clarity. We remain watchful. Coming to the bank. As you recall, we spelled it out in Q4 of last year and to be more precise, I think, somewhere around February.\\n\\nWe continue to be on the journey that we spelled out. Our credit deposit ratio has been brought down from the highs at the time of merger, which was at about $110 \\\\%$ to around $96 \\\\%$ as of March 2025. Our deposits have grown faster than the system and so has it grown faster than our loans as well.\\n\\nNext year, in line with what we had committed, the adjustment in CD ratio will not be so steep, supporting the loan growth for the bank, but it will be on a downward path. Cost remains under a tight leash, and we expect this to continue. Asset quality one of our USPs, remains pristine.\\n\\nAs liquidity and growth improve, we are well placed to grow in both assets and deposits. We have been doing a lot of work on technology over the last few years and we should start reaping the benefits of the same gradually during the course of the year. This is a space to watch out for, and we shall unveil at the appropriate time.\",\n",

       "  'markdown': \"I would like to express my gratitude to all our employees for their hard work and performance and to our shareholders and all of you who are on this call for being very patient with us during this period of adjustment. Thank you so much.\\n\\nSrini, over to you.\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. Thank you, Sashi, for those remarks. With that, we can open it up, and we'll use the time for questions. Please go ahead whoever is on the queue, please.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nChintan Joshi:\\n\\nThank you very much sir. We'll take a first question from the line of Chintan Joshi from Autonomous. Please go ahead.\\n\\nHi, good evening. Can I start with NIM? Some expansion coming through this quarter, if you could explain what the drivers of that expansion was? And also how we can think about NIMs progressing over the next year? On one hand, you've got the rate cuts, but on the other hand, your funding synergies are gradually coming through. Do you think if you see 100 bps rate cycle, NIMs can be higher than where we are today?\\n\\nThat's on NIMs. And then the second question I have is more on the corporate sector. If I look at cash and investments on corporate sector balance sheet over the last 3, 4 years and how they park it in the banking system that's kind of gone up significantly. But these deposits are short term in nature, we don't have the LCR benefit like we have with the household sector, how does the bank take on these deposits? How do they use it?\\n\\nI assume they can't really be used for term lending. It would be helpful to understand in this period where we've got geopolitical uncertainty, there will be even more corporate deposits, how does the banking system or yourselves use that?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. Two things. One is at the macro level. First, I'll take the NIM first. You saw the NIM for us over the last 12 months if you see, operated in a very narrow band, 3.4 to 3.5. Last year, March quarter was 3.44; now on a core basis, 3.46; last quarter was 3.43 and so on, so it's in a very narrow band plus/minus 5 basis points here and there, that's where the NIM has operated. And if you look at the components of the NIM, one is the cost of funds, which is in one of our pages where we published that, which is I think is on Page number 15, I think it is in our deck.\\n\\nThe cost of funds is also very stable at about 4.9. And there are two things going on in the cost of funds to be stable there. One is the borrowing mix has come down during this time period, whatever is on the page there, you see that the borrowing mix in the first of the time period, December ' 23 was $21 \\\\%$ and then from then on last March, it was $18 \\\\%$ and now it is $14 \\\\%$ borrowing mix. So that's one of the tailwind that contributed as a positive item to the cost of funds.\\n\\nThen there is a headwind in the cost of funds we have seen is the customer preference towards time deposit. If you see the rate of growth even in the recent time period, time deposit rate of growth, INR2 trillion in a full year time period. In the quarter, this quarter, recent quarter, about INR0.8 trillion time deposit rate of growth, 20\\\\%-or-so, right? So we have seen that.\",\n",

       " {'index': 4,\n",
       "  'markdown': \"So the CASA ratio mix has not been favorable. It's an adverse variance there, right? But between all of these, the cost of funds, we kept it stable by selecting retail deposits and not pricing up on the nonretail deposits, and we'll come to the second aspect of what you asked.\\n\\nSo the nonretail we've been circumspect, even I think it's going back to almost December '23, that time period itself, we saw that the pricing on the nonretail deposit was unacceptably high and competitive without consideration for the liquidity lendable value of those deposits. So we remain circumspect and didn't price, but try to manage it in a way that it's in a very narrow band there.\\n\\nNow come to the yield on assets, the other component of the NIM before we get to the conclusion of what you'd asked. So if you look at the yield on assets, they've also been pretty stable between $8.3 \\\\%, 8.4 \\\\%$ that's the level at which we operated and that's how we manage that.\\n\\nNow yield on assets if you see here, the retail will give more yield than the nonretail because then you'll have to pay through credit cost in some manner now or at some point in time. But we have had a balanced growth there to manage this yield in a very stable band there.\\n\\nAnd again selection, we have seen over the last 12 months, 18 months, the corporate loans of the larger ticket corporate loans and the larger ticket SME loans, have been very competitive, particularly coming from certain public sector institutions where the growth is an objective and not necessarily margin or returns, we have seen that pricing is very, very low on those.\\n\\nI mean the loan spreads have been very low compared to the bond spreads. That means when the bond spreads moves up or down, the loan spreads is not moving, it's actually coming down, which is what we are seeing. Now we try to manage it through appropriate selection, both -- quality is, of course, the first criteria for selection. Quality passes, it has to pass the rate and if it doesn't passes, we were happy to let go and not necessarily bulk up the balance sheet because we said we can reposition the balance sheet and grow the loans at any time. So that's how we manage that.\\n\\nNow coming to what's happened in the recent time period; 3, 4 basis points always moves at any time for various reasons. So there's no one particular one we can say. Of course, there is a cash reserve ratio that changed sometime in December. So there was some positive impact last quarter and the balance of the positive impact in this quarter, call it, a couple of basis points.\\n\\nAnd then a few basis points moves up and down. There is no kind of a finesse. And similarly, when the NPA changes, lower agriculture in the March quarter that also is a good kind of a margin benefit you get to some extent, but they're all within a narrow band.\\n\\nNow where does it go? I don't want to provide an outlook where this goes. But all I want to tell you is that I described to you this long to tell you how we think about margin and how we manage, which is policy rates change, so the loans that are linked to policy rates like the repo rate gets changed right away, so which is a headwind.\\n\\nAnd the faster the policy rate changes, it starts to factor in faster. The deposit side or the funding side rates take time to factor it in. So I would urge not to look at quarter-to-quarter because it's not something that could be managed at all because the policy can change tomorrow and then the deposit rates can change over time.\",\n",

       "  'markdown': \"So you have to look at it at least a year or longer than a year to see how stable and how we are managing that margin level, which is what on the page that you are seeing shows that Page 15 at that kind of a level stability how it gets managed. That's the first part. The second part is you talked about the cash and investment and the corporate sector balance sheet, how it gets deployed.\\n\\nAgain, the first part I tried to answer that certain categories of deposits have lower lendable value and the market doesn't price appropriately for that lendable value because that's how it should be. Typically, those kind of segmented deposits should be lower than a retail because the retail is the highest lendable value you can get. But these type of deposits are priced far higher than the retail deposits. So thereby only for large relationships, and where we could get certain other product mix aligned well, we patronize and participate.\\n\\nAnd there are certain other institutions like affiliated institutions to large corporates that we patronize and hold it. That's because we want to keep the wallet share on our lending. We are the largest working capital bank in the country, so we want to keep that wallet share growing in a reasonable manner. So we participate to some extent on these. Otherwise, we don't bid for these kind of deposits.\\n\\nModerator: $\\\\quad$ Thank you. We'll take the next question from the line of Mahrukh Adajania from Nuvama. Please go ahead.\\n\\nMahrukh Adajania: Good evening and congratulations. I had two questions. The first one is on deposit growth. So large banks have cut deposit rates in the most popular buckets by 30 to 45 bps , which is of course transmission, but are you comfortable that the liquidity position has changed enough to support a healthy deposit growth for the system and yourself? Because tight liquidity was really a big issue for the last 1.5 years, except in the last 2 to 3 months. So that's my first question.\\n\\nAnd my second question is on your priority progress. Of course, your CRB has been growing faster than your other loans. But if at all there are any shortfalls, how would that be managed? Would that have any ROA impact, so just a focused discussion on how priority will be managed?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. First is if I get on the rates and deposits as such, right? One is that it's not -- the deposit rate change, if you noticed, while we may have had gone first or second or whatever it is, across the industry, you're seeing -- at least the large top 3, 5 players you are seeing responded to the policy rate change. So that's something that was part of the transmission process.\\n\\nThe loan transmission for good amount happens automatically because of the linked to policy rates. And on the deposit side, one has to manage it and announce it after deliberation. So you have seen that happen. So there is no change as such from a competitive positioning or whatever.\\n\\nAll that differentiates with that ability to reach, that means have the distribution reach, bring in new customers, have better engagement through the RMs, that's been what we have done in the past, that's how we have grown, if you see the past year, rate of deposit growth about 15.8\\\\%-orso, that's INR3.4 trillion in the year. So we continue to be optimistic and continue to have that approach of energy to get that market share gaining, right?\",\n",

       "  'markdown': \"So the rate is not a differentiator in the past, and we don't think rate is a differentiator to win something because that would be very transitional and a short-term approach to getting that. So that's one on deposits, right? We continue to be playing on an even field there, and we're confident of how we are positioned for that. Second aspect of what you asked is the priority sector lending.\\n\\nWhile the priority sector details get published in the annual report, but nevertheless, at an aggregate level, as we have said in the past, we do meet that $40 \\\\%$ that is required. We're slightly above that level in terms of the aggregate priority sector lending. There are two sub-segments, which is the small and marginal farmer segment and a weaker section that always calls for something that inorganically, that means how do we go and buy it in the market either through certificates, IBPC, PTCs or any other manner or through on-lending program.\\n\\nThere are several instruments that we use and we keep on. And if none of those economics work well, there is always the last resort is the RIDF. That's not our first -- if you don't get any of these done, then there is RIDF, right? If you look at the cost dynamics of any of these things, they all work almost very similar dynamics to the overall P\\\\&L. You rightfully so touched up on returns. What does it mean to returns? Whether you have one or the other instrument, the impact on the return is very similar, there's no difference. And that is what historically also we have done.\\n\\nEven if you look at the year that has gone by, we were about $1 \\\\%$-or-so short on these kind of segments. And even now, we continue to look for and search for how to close in that last $1 \\\\%$ across SMF for the weaker and we will endeavor to do and close as much as we can. If not, the alternatives are already there, yes.\\n\\nMahrukh Adajania: Okay, perfect. Thank you.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nAnand Swaminathan:\\n\\nI have a couple of questions. Sashi, first question is on CRB. There has been a lot of media noise around senior management and some changes. It would be great if you could give us some confidence around what's happening and give us some clarity around that?\\n\\nThat's number one. And number two, on ROAs. We have successfully defended the $1.8 \\\\%$ ROA we've been guiding for the last several quarters. Srini, as we go into the rate cut cycle and growth slightly improving in the FY '26, do we have enough levers to defend this $1.8 \\\\%$ level or we should expect a brief kind of decline and then come back above $1.8 \\\\%$ when growth eventually recovers?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. I'm going to get it started first in terms of what it is, right? See, if you see, we had a reorganization. And Rahul Shukla who heads the commercial and rural banking had taken personal time off and is on sabbatical, right? So he's taken some time off or whatever, family reasons and so on. And the reorganization is expected to accomplish a few things, right?\\n\\nOne is, if you see what is going on particularly in the rural segment, take -- example, I'll give you the -- how we are thinking about to drive certain synergy and capture the growth opportunity and bring some productivity, right?\",\n",

       "  'markdown': \"So that's both from a customer point of view, better engagement; and from people point of view, better productivity and what does it do to get that. One is, simple thing, if you take about agriculture, that's now part of the retail management team who handled the two-wheeler and auto business and so on, that's the same kind of a leadership that handles agriculture. So once we reach the farmer, you know that as part of the prior growth approach, we expanded our geographical reach to 2.25 lakh -- 225,000 villages.\\n\\nNow the next phase of this growth is having a presence there, we need to go capture the volumes, that is reach out in the vicinity of those villages the right kind of farmer to bring in. So right now, we envisage not to just do an agriculture loan because that particular town, that farmer, that family and the neighbors do need a 2 -wheeler, do need a car, auto loan and so on and so forth.\\n\\nSo under the same team that we are trying to get these kind of multiple products made available to them. And also, if you look at where this particular thing is positioned, it's also positioned alongside the gold loan business. You know that in the country, a lot of farmers have gold and use gold for financing appropriately and perhaps rightfully so to fund the requirements of the farm.\\n\\nAnd so now these synergies are expected. And what does it do? It enables us to have a frequent connect with that farmer and that community in the rural segment through these kind of products which we are having. So it enhances our periodicity at which we will touch that customer. And so since we are delivering multiple products to the same customer, we do anticipate this is supposed to give better people productivity.\\n\\nSo I gave you one example, and that's how if you look at anything, all of those things that we have done is expected to provide the significant lift in productivity across all of these product and geography and customer segments that we are operating. So that's one, I hope, that gives you the context of the CRB, what goes on...\\n\\nSashidhar Jagdishan:\\n\\nSrini, I would like to add to whatever you have said. Rahul was one of our very good business managers. And obviously, he did express, as Srini mentioned, his desire to go on a sabbatical because he had some personal matters to attend to with his family and the academics of his children.\\n\\nBut having said that, he built a very strong team. And as you probably heard Srini, we have reorganized the entire asset side of the balance sheet under an even more abler individual. As you know, Kaizad now handles the entire asset side of the balance sheet and the investment banking business. And all the heads who have been with us, we have, as we have mentioned several times in the past, we have a very good depth in management and they now all of them have now handle larger businesses and report to the Deputy Managing Director.\\n\\nI'm quite excited about this reorganization, and I'm sure that we will harness the most optimal way to find growth and as Srini mentioned, synergies between various asset groups so that we can optimize even our resources at the grassroots levels, so that there is not too much of an overlap. So this is going to be a very exciting period for us, and you will start to see a lot more efficiencies and even greater hunger than what we have seen from the CRB and the entire asset side of the balance sheet.\",\n",

So this is a year to watch out for in terms of the kind of benefits that will accrue from this so-called massive reorganization that we have undertaken during the year. Yes, Srini, over to you.\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: Yes. Thank you for that additional color. Very good. Now getting to your second aspect of ROA. See, if you see our ROA has operated around that 1.9 level, right, plus/minus a few basis points. Ever since we accomplished the merger July 1, 2023, it's been approximately around that level, right? We're consistently delivering there.\\n\\nWhen you had asked about what does it do in a different rate scenario, if whatever happens? I talked about the margin in a couple of questions before in terms of how we think about the margin to be within a stable range, right? So ROA similarly can move around 5, 10 basis points.\\n\\nOur long-term average of ROA, if you see, somewhere, I think we have published that also. Over a 10-year, 15-year period, if you see, anywhere between a merger or pre-merger or post-merger, any which way if you look at it, 1.9 to 2.1 .\\n\\nAnd for many instances, the frequency of two is the highest. And sometimes we'd had 1.9 and sometimes we'd 2.1. So that is the optimal level, right, at which it operates. If the ROA tends for better cost of credit or better margin that comes through and for cost efficiency and so on, to some extent, there is always a reinvestment opportunity because at the end of the day, our market share on deposits is 11 .\\n\\nOur market share on distribution, which is branches is $6 \\\\%$ and our market share on loans is $14 \\\\%$. So we still have enormous room and a need to make investments, pace those investments appropriately to keep growing for the long term. So that's in that narrow band that we operate. So there is no one particular -- can we have a 10 basis points change in a year possible? Absolutely possible. But can it be far higher than that? Not likely, right? Because we have operated in a stable band up or down.\\n\\nModerator: Thank you.\\n\\nAnand Swaminathan: Thank you Srini. That is very useful. Just a quick follow-up...\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nRikin Shah:\\n\\nI request you to join back the queue for follow-up question, please, as we have other participants waiting for their turn. Thank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Rikin Shah from IIFL. Please go ahead.\\n\\nThank you for the opportunity. Two quick questions. First one for the repo-link loans. Do they get repriced immediately as soon as the repo rate changes? Or is there usually a lag of a few months from the change of repo rate? And secondly, an extension to this, does the number of days impact your reported margins? That's the first question. And the second one is, was there any reversal on AIF provisions in this quarter? Those are my two questions.\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. So in terms of the timing of the repo rate change and so thereby the transmission or flowthrough, by product, it is different. If you think about mortgages, which is $30 \\\\%$ of the book-or-so,\",\n",

If you look at corporate loan or something, it can happen immediately.\\n\\nSo it depends on product to product and the contractual arrangements, which are there in terms of the repricing frequency. But no -- it will not be a kind of an annual or something like that. It can be a month, it can be a quarter, but not something that it takes a year to get that transmitted. And your second aspect of number of days, yes, it can be a couple of basis points, it happens all the time. And yes, that's possible.\\n\\nRikin Shah: Got it. And the reversal of AIF provision, please?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: AIF, there's nothing significant in this quarter in terms of the contingency. If you remember the AIF provision that we had last financial year, not the one that ended, was about INR1,200 croresor-so. Then after the RBI clarification in the beginning of the recent financial year, it was taken down. And then depending on the volumes that move up and down, it moves, but there's nothing significant as such on that, yes.\\n\\nRikin Shah: Okay. The context of this question, Srini, was that in Note number 15 to your results, it says that AIF-related provision stock is around INR288 crores right now. The last quarter, it read around INR350 crores. So I just wanted to clarify, was there any reversal or just some of the AIF investments matured and hence, you were not required to carry them?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: So yes, it was not required, but then it didn't survive to the P\\\\&L to the bottom because there are so many ins and outs that happens in the provision. So the way of contingent provision didn't happen because at the end, there was some net addition of INR60 crores for various other reasons. So it didn't survive to the P\\\\&L to the bottom line, yes.\\n\\nRikin Shah: Understood. Thank you very much.\\n\\nModerator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Kunal Shah from Citigroup. Please go ahead.\\n\\nKunal Shah: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. A couple of questions. So firstly, again, sorry to harp again on margins. But the way you have been indicating the balance sheet construct is such that we should be able to operate margins within a narrow band, does that really change with the relatively higher repo rate cut? Or do we have additional levers to still manage margins relatively better compared to that of peers?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: Yes. That's a good question, Kunal. Thanks for asking that. One is that when the policy rate changes in a steady manner over a longer period of time, you know that the adjustment that is required from a cost of funds catches up to neutralize -- to keep the margin safe. But if in quick succession the policy rate changes, then the matching of the cost of funds takes longer time. So that means you cannot look at whether it is in a narrow band in a quarter-to-quarter period. But when you look at a year, you will be able to see that it is in a very narrow band.\",\n",

       "  'markdown': \"Kunal Shah:\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan:\\n\\nKunal Shah:\\n\\nSure. So on CASA, we have been indicating that in the falling interest rate cycle, generally, we would tend to improve the CASA, but the rate action both on the savings as well as FD seems to be almost similar or savings is relatively higher, then would it be fair to assume that maybe the overall structurally declining SA that phase can very much continue?\\n\\nAnd maybe a follow-up on the LDR. When you indicated that now LDR we will not see a steep decline, are we changing a stance that we need to get it to the premerger level at an accelerated pace and maybe even if it holds relatively higher at 90,92 , we would be comfortable then over the next 18,24 months?\\n\\nOkay. First is the CASA. I do want to go back to describing that, right? The empirical study, both industry as well as for us, which is published CASA ratio and the policy rates if you see over a 15 year period through the up and down rate cycle, the CASA has moved in the opposite direction, which is when the rate goes up, CASA ratio goes down; and the rate starts to come down, there is some lag. It's not instantaneous. A few quarters lag, the CASA starts to go up.\\n\\nSo you'll see that if you map us over a 15 -year period and the industry, you'll see that it moves up and down. So we do -- if the empirical is repeated, there is no reason to believe that it would not be the same or we're not seeing something different as such, we should get the CASA back, but not in a hurry, right? Because there have been 2 rate cuts that have happened. We need to wait and see how this stabilizes, what the global macro effects, what it plays in the country, both from an inflation cost and purchasing power of people.\\n\\nWe need to see how all of those plays out, which you have seen in the last 12, 18 months that middle to the lower segment did not have adequate disposable income to be put in savings because they were using it for their day-to-day needs. So that's why you saw CASA had one more nuance to it that it came down, right? People had less to save. They were spending on certain things and money was moving from household to non-household and so on and so forth. So that's in terms of the CASA as such.\\n\\nAnd LDR?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: LDR, I'll take a shot at it to see. See, what we had described, Kunal, last quarter or even about a year ago is that the LDR will come down to the premerger level, 85 to 90 ; more precisely, it was 87 -and-change the quarter before the merger, 85 to 90 is what we have operated, that will come into that range in FY '27.\\n\\nSo that is why we saw that the loan growth in this year that went by, FY '25, will be lower than the prior year for the industry and we took that opportunity, both industry loan growth going down and pricing being not to our liking, we accelerated to say, let's take this opportunity to slow down even further. So we grew at $7.7 \\\\%$, the assets under management in this recent time period.\\n\\nWe have also indicated that in FY '26, we are subject to appropriate pricing, quality is always given, appropriate pricing that we will be growing at the market rate of growth. If you see the recent quarter that went by, March quarter ' 25 , our sequential momentum growth was about $3.3 \\\\%$, which call it approximately annualized $12 \\\\%$ or $13 \\\\%$ thereabout.\",\n",

So we do expect that FY ' 27 is when it will come below that 90 mark. So at this moment, there is no other approach that we are having. And we continue to power on getting the right kind of deposits at the right price to keep that leadership position and gaining market share on deposits.\\n\\nModerator: We'll take our next question from the line of Abhishek M. from HSBC.\\n\\nAbhishek M.: So a couple of very quick clarifications and then one question. The first is when you say repo cut gets passed on right away, does it happen exactly right away or does it happen on a particular day in a month or a particular day in a quarter? When does the transmission actually happen?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: It can happen -- if your repricing date is set for 15th, it is 15th. If Bhavin's reset date is set for 25th, it is 25 th. If my reset date is 5 th, it is 5 th. And it depends product to product. And that means the mortgage product is different. Wholesale product is different. SME product is different. So it is different product. There's no one that is what it's broadly. Will a good amount reprice in a month? Yes. Will most of it reprice in 3 months? Absolutely.\\n\\nAbhishek M.: Right. So the cumulative impact will probably be seen in Q1 may not have been seen in Q4 yet, that's the understanding, right?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: That is correct.\\n\\nAbhishek M.: Right. And then just in terms of the...\\n\\nBhavin Lakhpatwala: Abhishek, also the fact that quarter 4 -- Abhishek, the first repo rate cut happened in February itself. So even the full quarter impact of that you have not seen, you will see that only in the April to June quarter. So you'll see the full 50 basis points impact happening in this quarter, what you've not seen perhaps in the fourth quarter.\\n\\nAbhishek M.: Perfect. Yes. That's what I wanted to clarify. And therefore, in terms of the NIM trajectory, right, 1 Q would anyway not have any benefit from the TD cuts that you are taking now? So there should be a bigger impact in 1Q and then through the year, you would see some benefit of the rate cut, etcetera, that you're taking, that should build up...\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: That is correct, but I do not want to talk about it quarter-to-quarter at all. You should look at a year because we do not know what will come next week or next month, so we will handle it as a management appropriately to market needs and customer needs.\\n\\nAbhishek M.: Yes, fair enough. And therefore, in terms of this 2\\\\% ROA target, let's say, is this like now a 2-year or a 3-year kind of target? Because it will take time for cost of funds to catch up and for policy rates to maybe stabilize at some level. So does this become like a ' 27 or ' 28 kind of target for you?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: I don't want to give you an outlook. And by the way, I do not know where you picked up a target of a $2 \\\\%$ ROA. We've not specified that. All we specified even in this call earlier was that when you look at the frequency of the $2 \\\\%$ over the last 10 years or 15 years, the $2 \\\\%$ has been the maximum frequency at which we have hit on an annual basis. That's what I mentioned.\",\n",

Basically, do you have any other levers in your P\\\\&L, maybe fees or maybe opex where you could see some improvement from here?\\n\\nWe have told you about the opex, right, in terms of how we have made investments, if you think about the branch investments, and so the time for getting some realization benefits as well as the productivity benefits are on the anvil on that. If you look at a 5-year period, 250 branches to 350 branches to 750 to 1,400 -something to 900 to 700 something now. So in terms of the branches, this is the last 5, 6 years, if you see that we have built, right? Even the recent time period, 700 branches, if you see, is almost $2 x$ what we were doing 5 years ago in terms of the branch.\\n\\nSo we have accelerated and made those investments. And now we are pressing on that to get better productivity, and thereby, the efficiency to come in. Again, the trajectory of that is not quarter-toquarter, not linear, but the trajectory of that is for the cost to income to improve. And again, one other aspect I do want to tell not just look at cost to income, please look at cost to assets too, where we are the best-in-class in terms of cost to assets at about 1.9-and-change.\\n\\nAbhishek M.:\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan:\\n\\nAbhishek M:\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nHarsh Modi:\\n\\nYes, exactly. So that is why I was wondering if it can improve even further from here because you're already very efficient when you compare to your peers?\\n\\nWe are efficient, and we continue to press on new technologies and press on greater productivity, yes, indeed.\\n\\nGot it. Okay. Thank you so much and all the best.\\n\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Harsh Modi from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\\n\\nYes, hi. Thanks for allowing to ask questions. First is on CASA market share. Could you provide some details over, let's say, next 18 months to 24 months, how do you see your both CA and SA market share evolve and is there any particular number that we could think about in terms of CASA ratio, let's say, over 18 months to 24 months?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: In a different form, it's the same question of an outlook or a target that want us to specify. The opportunity exists. Our total market share is 11. The time deposit or CASA market share is give and take around that level. So which means we are evenly positioned, take time deposit could be 11.5 and CASA could be 10.5 and so somewhere in that level. That's where we are in terms of the market share.\\n\\nThe opportunity exists across both of this. I do want one other very important factor to tell and which we have been mentioning over the last 3 years, 4 years. The penetration of time deposit in our customer base is low. So we do see opportunity space for getting better customer relationship through those time deposits. So we cannot leave it on the table to say just because it is time deposit, we don't want.\\n\\nWe want that customer relationship because that's based on customer needs. So I cannot tell you that we drive to one ratio and our goal is to have this ratio and so on. Our goal is to have the predominant share, wallet share of the customer whatever comes. And so thereby, that is how it is\",\n",

Okay, I understand that, Srini. If I could rephrase the question, especially for savings account market share. Incremental savings account market share over next 18 months to 24 months given your investments in branches that you just explained and technology and best-in-class distribution network, do you expect to gain meaningful market share on savings account in next 18 to 24 month or would you probably just be maintaining your market share over the next 18 to 24 months, how do we think about that?\\n\\nOur ambition and our historical experience has always been to gain market share. That is how we are positioned. How much we gain depends on market conditions at any point in time and the disposable income in the hands of the customers, depending on how the inflation plays out, how the wage growth plays out and so on and so forth and market returns as well as is another aspect of it, yes, which we have seen in the last 12 months when the market returns were high, we have seen some investment into the markets.\\n\\nAll right. Thank you.\\n\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Param Subramanian from Investec. Please go ahead.\\n\\nHi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just a few data-keeping questions. Firstly, what is the maturity of the term deposits on book? I don't mean on sourcing, on book. And similarly how much of your borrowings mature over the course of next year?\\n\\nNo, you'll get some of these things you'll get once the annual report is out. We don't have that, some of these things handy because it belongs to multiple buckets that goes through. So on the time deposit, we can't really have a number to give out to say this is a maturity that you're looking for. And sorry the second question.\\n\\nYes, broad number would also do, Bhavin?\\n\\nNo, it's not something which we can just, I mean, difficult to put a number out that way. And sorry, can you repeat the second question again, please?\\n\\nOn borrowings over the next 12 months.\\n\\nSee, two things on borrowings. There is a maturity profile, which also last time we published, I think it's 0.5 trillion or thereabouts of the legacy bond borrowings will mature. And we will have opportunity space to have some new borrowings, which is infrastructure borrowings, which could be much more cost effective. So it depends on the market rates and there's no one particular strategy. We do the breakeven between certain category of deposits and infrastructure borrowings.\\n\\nAnd in many instances, we see the infra borrowings could be better. So again, I don't know what the market rate will be when we go to the market, but both of these are -- we will have some borrowings, infra borrowings at a cost-effective way and there will be a certain level of maturity\",\n",

       "  'markdown': \"that will happen which is, again 0.5 trillion or thereabouts, that will happen. And keep in mind that the borrowing mix to the total liabilities now stands at about $14 \\\\%$.\\n\\nPremerger, it was in single digit call it $8 \\\\%$ or thereabouts $9 \\\\%$. So ideally, somewhere in the long term, it will transition towards that level. A combination of both balance sheet growth as well as some maturity and replaced modestly with cost-effective borrowings.\\n\\nParam Subramanian: Thanks Srini. Just one additional part. How much of your borrowing is, say, floating rate hedged as we go into this rate cycle, just a relevant question there. And secondly, last quarter, you had given a number on the PSL shortfall in SMF and weaker section being about $1 \\\\%$, where are we there broadly?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: About that percent-or-so is where it is. We endeavor to close it, but that is always -- we chase volumes at different categories, as I told you on that. Then your first part of the question...\\n\\nBhavin Lakhpatwala: Is borrowing that hedge? It continues to be around $60 \\\\%, 65 \\\\%$ of the borrowings, which will be hedged, which is again from the HDFC Limited book, which is what we've always had that.\\n\\nParam Subramanian: And which is the relevant floating benchmark once you look at...\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nDeekshant:\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: I guess you are talking about the industry level. You've seen us through various cycles, we've been pretty steady. Our NPAs have been quite steady other than the year or two of COVID. Even those time periods, maybe 20 basis points, it went up, but otherwise we've been operating in a very narrow band on nonperforming loans and so on. I guess your question is more philosophical in terms of what's happening in the industry and where that is heading.\\n\\nIf you listen to our Chief Credit Officer, he has done various analysis to say that the credit cycle bottomed out maybe even three quarters ago, four quarters ago and which you have seen at the industry level, the nonperforming loans going up and the credit cost beginning to go up. The offset has always been some of the legacy loans 5 years, 10 years, whatever legacy loans some recoveries and repayments have happened against those.\\n\\nSo you don't necessarily see the full effect of that through the P\\\\&L at the industry level. You don't see that. So whether the credit NPAs and credit costs will normalize over the next 1 year, 3 years, it should, but that should be at a lower level than what historically we have seen is the assessment of our credit officers.\",\n",

Our segmentation of customers, whether it's corporate, whether it's SME, whether it is retail is very clear. We have tested these segments over a long period of time and we probably have a reasonable fix on the expected loss, credit losses in that. And the opportunity to nibble away more share in these kind of customer segments is huge.\\n\\nAs I said, it is up to us the pace at which we want to grow, but it doesn't mean that the proportion of our losses is going to go up just because we are growing fast because we're going to be limiting ourselves only to the segment that we are comfortable to operate.\\n\\nSo Srini did allude to it. If you take a 25 -year history of our expect actual credit loss experience adjusted for some of the event risk and also mergers, you will find that we have been virtually on a flat basis or on a straight-line basis across the X axis of the curve.\\n\\nSo growth does not mean our losses or loss ratios will go up. I think it should be more or less in a range bound because of the target segment that we would still like to -- because there is opportunity, there's a runway, and we would want to stick to this opportunity and not go down the risk ladders.\\n\\nSir, there is no question that we are the best-in-class when it comes to like loan performances and even the way that we issue the loans. Just to like narrow this question a little bit more: There seems to be an early sign of some sort of SME growth that can come in. Sir, also alluded to that some of the things have bottomed out right now.\\n\\nConsidering that SME growth does come in and even the retail loans do start coming in better, namely the home loans, do we think that the incremental growth of market share that we are focusing on will that come at the cost which would be lower on the lower end of our range of our NPA cycle or would that be at a higher end of the range of NPA cycle?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: So getting directly to that question in terms of whether we would go down the credit ladder to pick up the volumes? The short answer is no. Credit policies will not be changed to pick up volumes. They have been stable and they're consistent. And the market opportunity presents very well to capture.\\n\\nIn addition to the credit, one other important dimension that determines whether we pick up that loan or not is also the rate at which we can do. And the third dimension that is required is we just not want to be a lending institution to anybody. We want it to be a relationship bank, including SME.\\n\\nWe want that proprietor or partners, their family, even if there are 5 employees or 3 employees or 50 employees, their employee account, the primary banking need to be with us. So we are not going to do lending just as a product of lending. It is for the total banking relationship we want from that particular transaction that we go into.\\n\\nOkay. Sir, just one last follow-up here...\\n\\nDeekshant, I request you to join back the queue please as we have other participants waiting.\",\n",

Yes. |\\n| Piran Engineer: | So congrats on the quarter. My first question is, has the industry or have we started cutting lending <br> rates on fixed rate products like vehicle loans or personal loans after the 50 bps repo rate cut? |\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: See, no, I don't know, but we are not -- we are seeing intense competition. We've not seen anything different now than what we saw 6 months ago from a price competitiveness point of view, let it be mortgage product or auto product and so on. So that's one from an industry point of view. I will not be able to talk about their risk-based pricing model.\\n\\nBut for us, we have a band of risk-based pricing product. For a given risk profile what is the kind of a price band that we can operate and that has been consistent and we'll operate in the same manner there.\\n\\nPiran Engineer: Okay. So it's fair to say we've not cut lending rates like in auto loans, etc.?\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: No, we've not cut, but we do have a risk-based pricing model for us given a risk profile of a customer. So my profile may be different from my colleague's profile, and so it depends on what it is, so we get different rates.\\n\\nPiran Engineer: Okay. Fair. And sir, just secondly, on your unsecured book of roughly INR2 lakh crores, what percentage would be unsecured business loans? And can you also just talk a bit about this business, the customer profile? Are these repeat loans to existing customers? Or do you also acquire fresh new-to-bank customers through this product?\\n\\nAnd are there -- like when we have the retail asset quality cycle -- by we, I mean the industry, are there some signs of stress in unsecured business loans? Just an overview of this would be useful.\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay, yes. One you see that we published personal loans, which is almost about close to INR2 trillion or-so, right, as of the quarter end INR2 trillion or so. See call it, about $75 \\\\%, 80 \\\\%$ of them are salaried customers, mostly salaried with us or if it is taken from the market still salaried.

       "Hi, good evening. Can I start with NIM? Some expansion coming through this quarter, if you could explain what the drivers of that expansion was? And also how we can think about NIMs progressing over the next year? On one hand, you've got the rate cuts, but on the other hand, your funding synergies are gradually coming through. Do you think if you see 100 bps rate cycle, NIMs can be higher than where we are today?\n",
       "\n",
       "That's on NIMs. And then the second question I have is more on the corporate sector. If I look at cash and investments on corporate sector balance sheet over the last 3, 4 years and how they park it in the banking system that's kind of gone up significantly. But these deposits are short term in nature, we don't have the LCR benefit like we have with the household sector, how does the bank take on these deposits? How do they use it?\n",
       "\n",
       "I assume they can't really be used for term lending. It would be helpful to understand in this period where we've got geopolitical uncertainty, there will be even more corporate deposits, how does the banking system or yourselves use that?\n",
       "\n",
       "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. Two things. One is at the macro level. First, I'll take the NIM first. You saw the NIM for us over the last 12 months if you see, operated in a very narrow band, 3.4 to 3.5. Last year, March quarter was 3.44; now on a core basis, 3.46; last quarter was 3.43 and so on, so it's in a very narrow band plus/minus 5 basis points here and there, that's where the NIM has operated. And if you look at the components of the NIM, one is the cost of funds, which is in one of our pages where we published that, which is I think is on Page number 15, I think it is in our deck.\n",
       "\n",
       "The cost of funds is also very stable at about 4.9. And there are two things going on in the cost of funds to be stable there. One is the borrowing mix has come down during this time period, whatever is on the page there, you see that the borrowing mix in the first of the time period, December ' 23 was $21 \\%$ and then from then on last March, it was $18 \\%$ and now it is $14 \\%$ borrowing mix. So that's one of the tailwind that contributed as a positive item to the cost of funds.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then there is a headwind in the cost of funds we have seen is the customer preference towards time deposit. If you see the rate of growth even in the recent time period, time deposit rate of growth, INR2 trillion in a full year time period. In the quarter, this quarter, recent quarter, about INR0.8 trillion time deposit rate of growth, 20\\%-or-so, right? So we have seen that.\n",
       "\n",
       "So the CASA ratio mix has not been favorable. It's an adverse variance there, right? But between all of these, the cost of funds, we kept it stable by selecting retail deposits and not pricing up on the nonretail deposits, and we'll come to the second aspect of what you asked.\n",
       "\n",
       "So the nonretail we've been circumspect, even I think it's going back to almost December '23, that time period itself, we saw that the pricing on the nonretail deposit was unacceptably high and competitive without consideration for the liquidity lendable value of those deposits. So we remain circumspect and didn't price, but try to manage it in a way that it's in a very narrow band there.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now come to the yield on assets, the other component of the NIM before we get to the conclusion of what you'd asked. So if you look at the yield on assets, they've also been pretty stable between $8.3 \\%, 8.4 \\%$ that's the level at which we operated and that's how we manage that.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now yield on assets if you see here, the retail will give more yield than the nonretail because then you'll have to pay through credit cost in some manner now or at some point in time. But we have had a balanced growth there to manage this yield in a very stable band there.\n",
       "\n",
       "And again selection, we have seen over the last 12 months, 18 months, the corporate loans of the larger ticket corporate loans and the larger ticket SME loans, have been very competitive, particularly coming from certain public sector institutions where the growth is an objective and not necessarily margin or returns, we have seen that pricing is very, very low on those.\n",
       "\n",
       "I mean the loan spreads have been very low compared to the bond spreads. That means when the bond spreads moves up or down, the loan spreads is not moving, it's actually coming down, which is what we are seeing. Now we try to manage it through appropriate selection, both -- quality is, of course, the first criteria for selection. Quality passes, it has to pass the rate and if it doesn't passes, we were happy to let go and not necessarily bulk up the balance sheet because we said we can reposition the balance sheet and grow the loans at any time. So that's how we manage that.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now coming to what's happened in the recent time period; 3, 4 basis points always moves at any time for various reasons. So there's no one particular one we can say. Of course, there is a cash reserve ratio that changed sometime in December. So there was some positive impact last quarter and the balance of the positive impact in this quarter, call it, a couple of basis points.\n",
       "\n",
       "And then a few basis points moves up and down. There is no kind of a finesse. And similarly, when the NPA changes, lower agriculture in the March quarter that also is a good kind of a margin benefit you get to some extent, but they're all within a narrow band.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now where does it go? I don't want to provide an outlook where this goes. But all I want to tell you is that I described to you this long to tell you how we think about margin and how we manage, which is policy rates change, so the loans that are linked to policy rates like the repo rate gets changed right away, so which is a headwind.\n",
       "\n",
       "And the faster the policy rate changes, it starts to factor in faster. The deposit side or the funding side rates take time to factor it in. So I would urge not to look at quarter-to-quarter because it's not something that could be managed at all because the policy can change tomorrow and then the deposit rates can change over time.\n",
       "\n",
       "So you have to look at it at least a year or longer than a year to see how stable and how we are managing that margin level, which is what on the page that you are seeing shows that Page 15 at that kind of a level stability how it gets managed. That's the first part. The second part is you talked about the cash and investment and the corporate sector balance sheet, how it gets deployed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Again, the first part I tried to answer that certain categories of deposits have lower lendable value and the market doesn't price appropriately for that lendable value because that's how it should be. Typically, those kind of segmented deposits should be lower than a retail because the retail is the highest lendable value you can get. But these type of deposits are priced far higher than the retail deposits. So thereby only for large relationships, and where we could get certain other product mix aligned well, we patronize and participate.\n",
       "\n",
       "And there are certain other institutions like affiliated institutions to large corporates that we patronize and hold it. That's because we want to keep the wallet share on our lending. We are the largest working capital bank in the country, so we want to keep that wallet share growing in a reasonable manner. So we participate to some extent on these. Otherwise, we don't bid for these kind of deposits.\n",

       "Moderator: $\\quad$ Thank you. We'll take the next question from the line of Mahrukh Adajania from Nuvama. Please go ahead.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mahrukh Adajania: Good evening and congratulations. I had two questions. The first one is on deposit growth. So large banks have cut deposit rates in the most popular buckets by 30 to 45 bps , which is of course transmission, but are you comfortable that the liquidity position has changed enough to support a healthy deposit growth for the system and yourself? Because tight liquidity was really a big issue for the last 1.5 years, except in the last 2 to 3 months. So that's my first question.\n",
       "\n",
       "And my second question is on your priority progress. Of course, your CRB has been growing faster than your other loans. But if at all there are any shortfalls, how would that be managed? Would that have any ROA impact, so just a focused discussion on how priority will be managed?\n",
       "\n",
       "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. First is if I get on the rates and deposits as such, right? One is that it's not -- the deposit rate change, if you noticed, while we may have had gone first or second or whatever it is, across the industry, you're seeing -- at least the large top 3, 5 players you are seeing responded to the policy rate change. So that's something that was part of the transmission process.\n",
       "\n",
       "The loan transmission for good amount happens automatically because of the linked to policy rates. And on the deposit side, one has to manage it and announce it after deliberation. So you have seen that happen. So there is no change as such from a competitive positioning or whatever.\n",
       "\n",
       "All that differentiates with that ability to reach, that means have the distribution reach, bring in new customers, have better engagement through the RMs, that's been what we have done in the past, that's how we have grown, if you see the past year, rate of deposit growth about 15.8\\%-orso, that's INR3.4 trillion in the year. So we continue to be optimistic and continue to have that approach of energy to get that market share gaining, right?\n",
       "\n",
       "So the rate is not a differentiator in the past, and we don't think rate is a differentiator to win something because that would be very transitional and a short-term approach to getting that. So that's one on deposits, right? We continue to be playing on an even field there, and we're confident of how we are positioned for that. Second aspect of what you asked is the priority sector lending.\n",
       "\n",
       "While the priority sector details get published in the annual report, but nevertheless, at an aggregate level, as we have said in the past, we do meet that $40 \\%$ that is required. We're slightly above that level in terms of the aggregate priority sector lending. There are two sub-segments, which is the small and marginal farmer segment and a weaker section that always calls for something that inorganically, that means how do we go and buy it in the market either through certificates, IBPC, PTCs or any other manner or through on-lending program.\n",
       "\n",
       "There are several instruments that we use and we keep on. And if none of those economics work well, there is always the last resort is the RIDF. That's not our first -- if you don't get any of these done, then there is RIDF, right? If you look at the cost dynamics of any of these things, they all work almost very similar dynamics to the overall P\\&L. You rightfully so touched up on returns. What does it mean to returns? Whether you have one or the other instrument, the impact on the return is very similar, there's no difference. And that is what historically also we have done.\n",
       "\n",
       "Even if you look at the year that has gone by, we were about $1 \\%$-or-so short on these kind of segments. And even now, we continue to look for and search for how to close in that last $1 \\%$ across SMF for the weaker and we will endeavor to do and close as much as we can. If not, the alternatives are already there, yes.\n",

       "I have a couple of questions. Sashi, first question is on CRB. There has been a lot of media noise around senior management and some changes. It would be great if you could give us some confidence around what's happening and give us some clarity around that?\n",
       "\n",
       "That's number one. And number two, on ROAs. We have successfully defended the $1.8 \\%$ ROA we've been guiding for the last several quarters. Srini, as we go into the rate cut cycle and growth slightly improving in the FY '26, do we have enough levers to defend this $1.8 \\%$ level or we should expect a brief kind of decline and then come back above $1.8 \\%$ when growth eventually recovers?\n",
       "\n",
       "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. I'm going to get it started first in terms of what it is, right? See, if you see, we had a reorganization. And Rahul Shukla who heads the commercial and rural banking had taken personal time off and is on sabbatical, right? So he's taken some time off or whatever, family reasons and so on. And the reorganization is expected to accomplish a few things, right?\n",
       "\n",
       "One is, if you see what is going on particularly in the rural segment, take -- example, I'll give you the -- how we are thinking about to drive certain synergy and capture the growth opportunity and bring some productivity, right?\n",
       "\n",
       "So that's both from a customer point of view, better engagement; and from people point of view, better productivity and what does it do to get that. One is, simple thing, if you take about agriculture, that's now part of the retail management team who handled the two-wheeler and auto business and so on, that's the same kind of a leadership that handles agriculture. So once we reach the farmer, you know that as part of the prior growth approach, we expanded our geographical reach to 2.25 lakh -- 225,000 villages.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now the next phase of this growth is having a presence there, we need to go capture the volumes, that is reach out in the vicinity of those villages the right kind of farmer to bring in. So right now, we envisage not to just do an agriculture loan because that particular town, that farmer, that family and the neighbors do need a 2 -wheeler, do need a car, auto loan and so on and so forth.\n",
       "\n",
       "So under the same team that we are trying to get these kind of multiple products made available to them. And also, if you look at where this particular thing is positioned, it's also positioned alongside the gold loan business. You know that in the country, a lot of farmers have gold and use gold for financing appropriately and perhaps rightfully so to fund the requirements of the farm.\n",
       "\n",
       "And so now these synergies are expected. And what does it do? It enables us to have a frequent connect with that farmer and that community in the rural segment through these kind of products which we are having. So it enhances our periodicity at which we will touch that customer. And so since we are delivering multiple products to the same customer, we do anticipate this is supposed to give better people productivity.\n",
       "\n",
       "So I gave you one example, and that's how if you look at anything, all of those things that we have done is expected to provide the significant lift in productivity across all of these product and geography and customer segments that we are operating. So that's one, I hope, that gives you the context of the CRB, what goes on...\n",
       "\n",
       "Sashidhar Jagdishan:\n",
       "\n",
       "Srini, I would like to add to whatever you have said. Rahul was one of our very good business managers. And obviously, he did express, as Srini mentioned, his desire to go on a sabbatical because he had some personal matters to attend to with his family and the academics of his children.\n",
       "\n",
       "But having said that, he built a very strong team. And as you probably heard Srini, we have reorganized the entire asset side of the balance sheet under an even more abler individual. As you know, Kaizad now handles the entire asset side of the balance sheet and the investment banking business. And all the heads who have been with us, we have, as we have mentioned several times in the past, we have a very good depth in management and they now all of them have now handle larger businesses and report to the Deputy Managing Director.\n",
       "\n",
       "I'm quite excited about this reorganization, and I'm sure that we will harness the most optimal way to find growth and as Srini mentioned, synergies between various asset groups so that we can optimize even our resources at the grassroots levels, so that there is not too much of an overlap. So this is going to be a very exciting period for us, and you will start to see a lot more efficiencies and even greater hunger than what we have seen from the CRB and the entire asset side of the balance sheet.\n",
       "\n",
       "Obviously, optimizing yields, optimizing the need to maintain priority sector requirements and other aspects as well. So this is a year to watch out for in terms of the kind of benefits that will accrue from this so-called massive reorganization that we have undertaken during the year. Yes, Srini, over to you.\n",
       "\n",
       "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: Yes. Thank you for that additional color. Very good. Now getting to your second aspect of ROA. See, if you see our ROA has operated around that 1.9 level, right, plus/minus a few basis points. Ever since we accomplished the merger July 1, 2023, it's been approximately around that level, right? We're consistently delivering there.\n",
       "\n",
       "When you had asked about what does it do in a different rate scenario, if whatever happens? I talked about the margin in a couple of questions before in terms of how we think about the margin to be within a stable range, right? So ROA similarly can move around 5, 10 basis points.\n",
       "\n",
       "Our long-term average of ROA, if you see, somewhere, I think we have published that also. Over a 10-year, 15-year period, if you see, anywhere between a merger or pre-merger or post-merger, any which way if you look at it, 1.9 to 2.1 .\n",
       "\n",
       "And for many instances, the frequency of two is the highest. And sometimes we'd had 1.9 and sometimes we'd 2.1. So that is the optimal level, right, at which it operates. If the ROA tends for better cost of credit or better margin that comes through and for cost efficiency and so on, to some extent, there is always a reinvestment opportunity because at the end of the day, our market share on deposits is 11 .\n",
       "\n",
       "Our market share on distribution, which is branches is $6 \\%$ and our market share on loans is $14 \\%$. So we still have enormous room and a need to make investments, pace those investments appropriately to keep growing for the long term. So that's in that narrow band that we operate. So there is no one particular -- can we have a 10 basis points change in a year possible? Absolutely possible. But can it be far higher than that? Not likely, right? Because we have operated in a stable band up or down.\n",
       "\n",
       "Moderator: Thank you.\n",
       "\n",
       "Anand Swaminathan: Thank you Srini. That is very useful. Just a quick follow-up...\n",

       "\n",
       "I request you to join back the queue for follow-up question, please, as we have other participants waiting for their turn. Thank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Rikin Shah from IIFL. Please go ahead.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thank you for the opportunity. Two quick questions. First one for the repo-link loans. Do they get repriced immediately as soon as the repo rate changes? Or is there usually a lag of a few months from the change of repo rate? And secondly, an extension to this, does the number of days impact your reported margins? That's the first question. And the second one is, was there any reversal on AIF provisions in this quarter? Those are my two questions.\n",
       "\n",
       "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. So in terms of the timing of the repo rate change and so thereby the transmission or flowthrough, by product, it is different. If you think about mortgages, which is $30 \\%$ of the book-or-so,\n",
       "\n",
       "it can happen in the immediate cycle, rate changes and in the following month cycle, it can happen. So it can be anywhere within a month, it can happen. If you look at corporate loan or something, it can happen immediately.\n",
       "\n",
       "So it depends on product to product and the contractual arrangements, which are there in terms of the repricing frequency. But no -- it will not be a kind of an annual or something like that. It can be a month, it can be a quarter, but not something that it takes a year to get that transmitted. And your second aspect of number of days, yes, it can be a couple of basis points, it happens all the time. And yes, that's possible.\n",
       "\n",
       "Rikin Shah: Got it. And the reversal of AIF provision, please?\n",
       "\n",
       "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: AIF, there's nothing significant in this quarter in terms of the contingency. If you remember the AIF provision that we had last financial year, not the one that ended, was about INR1,200 croresor-so. Then after the RBI clarification in the beginning of the recent financial year, it was taken down. And then depending on the volumes that move up and down, it moves, but there's nothing significant as such on that, yes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Rikin Shah: Okay. The context of this question, Srini, was that in Note number 15 to your results, it says that AIF-related provision stock is around INR288 crores right now. The last quarter, it read around INR350 crores. So I just wanted to clarify, was there any reversal or just some of the AIF investments matured and hence, you were not required to carry them?\n",
       "\n",
       "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: So yes, it was not required, but then it didn't survive to the P\\&L to the bottom because there are so many ins and outs that happens in the provision. So the way of contingent provision didn't happen because at the end, there was some net addition of INR60 crores for various other reasons. So it didn't survive to the P\\&L to the bottom line, yes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Rikin Shah: Understood. Thank you very much.\n",
       "\n",
       "Moderator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Kunal Shah from Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n",
       "\n",
       "Kunal Shah: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. A couple of questions. So firstly, again, sorry to harp again on margins. But the way you have been indicating the balance sheet construct is such that we should be able to operate margins within a narrow band, does that really change with the relatively higher repo rate cut? Or do we have additional levers to still manage margins relatively better compared to that of peers?\n",
       "\n",
       "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: Yes. That's a good question, Kunal. Thanks for asking that. One is that when the policy rate changes in a steady manner over a longer period of time, you know that the adjustment that is required from a cost of funds catches up to neutralize -- to keep the margin safe. But if in quick succession the policy rate changes, then the matching of the cost of funds takes longer time. So that means you cannot look at whether it is in a narrow band in a quarter-to-quarter period. But when you look at a year, you will be able to see that it is in a very narrow band.\n",
       "\n",
       "Kunal Shah:\n",
       "\n",
       "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan:\n",
       "\n",
       "Kunal Shah:\n",
       "\n",
       "Sure. So on CASA, we have been indicating that in the falling interest rate cycle, generally, we would tend to improve the CASA, but the rate action both on the savings as well as FD seems to be almost similar or savings is relatively higher, then would it be fair to assume that maybe the overall structurally declining SA that phase can very much continue?\n",
       "\n",
       "And maybe a follow-up on the LDR. When you indicated that now LDR we will not see a steep decline, are we changing a stance that we need to get it to the premerger level at an accelerated pace and maybe even if it holds relatively higher at 90,92 , we would be comfortable then over the next 18,24 months?\n",
       "\n",
       "Okay. First is the CASA. I do want to go back to describing that, right? The empirical study, both industry as well as for us, which is published CASA ratio and the policy rates if you see over a 15 year period through the up and down rate cycle, the CASA has moved in the opposite direction, which is when the rate goes up, CASA ratio goes down; and the rate starts to come down, there is some lag. It's not instantaneous. A few quarters lag, the CASA starts to go up.\n",
       "\n",
       "So you'll see that if you map us over a 15 -year period and the industry, you'll see that it moves up and down. So we do -- if the empirical is repeated, there is no reason to believe that it would not be the same or we're not seeing something different as such, we should get the CASA back, but not in a hurry, right? Because there have been 2 rate cuts that have happened. We need to wait and see how this stabilizes, what the global macro effects, what it plays in the country, both from an inflation cost and purchasing power of people.\n",
       "\n",
       "We need to see how all of those plays out, which you have seen in the last 12, 18 months that middle to the lower segment did not have adequate disposable income to be put in savings because they were using it for their day-to-day needs. So that's why you saw CASA had one more nuance to it that it came down, right? People had less to save. They were spending on certain things and money was moving from household to non-household and so on and so forth. So that's in terms of the CASA as such.\n",
       "\n",
       "And LDR?\n",
       "\n",
       "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: LDR, I'll take a shot at it to see. See, what we had described, Kunal, last quarter or even about a year ago is that the LDR will come down to the premerger level, 85 to 90 ; more precisely, it was 87 -and-change the quarter before the merger, 85 to 90 is what we have operated, that will come into that range in FY '27.\n",
       "\n",
       "So that is why we saw that the loan growth in this year that went by, FY '25, will be lower than the prior year for the industry and we took that opportunity, both industry loan growth going down and pricing being not to our liking, we accelerated to say, let's take this opportunity to slow down even further. So we grew at $7.7 \\%$, the assets under management in this recent time period.\n",
       "\n",
       "We have also indicated that in FY '26, we are subject to appropriate pricing, quality is always given, appropriate pricing that we will be growing at the market rate of growth. If you see the recent quarter that went by, March quarter ' 25 , our sequential momentum growth was about $3.3 \\%$, which call it approximately annualized $12 \\%$ or $13 \\%$ thereabout.\n",
       "\n",
       "So I'm not giving you an outlook of what you should expect, I'm just describing what happened in the recent time period and that's the kind of velocity at which it was growing. So we do expect that FY ' 27 is when it will come below that 90 mark. So at this moment, there is no other approach that we are having. And we continue to power on getting the right kind of deposits at the right price to keep that leadership position and gaining market share on deposits.\n",
       "\n",
       "Moderator: We'll take our next question from the line of Abhishek M. from HSBC.\n",
       "\n",
       "Abhishek M.: So a couple of very quick clarifications and then one question. The first is when you say repo cut gets passed on right away, does it happen exactly right away or does it happen on a particular day in a month or a particular day in a quarter? When does the transmission actually happen?\n",
       "\n",
       "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: It can happen -- if your repricing date is set for 15th, it is 15th. If Bhavin's reset date is set for 25th, it is 25 th. If my reset date is 5 th, it is 5 th. And it depends product to product. And that means the mortgage product is different. Wholesale product is different. SME product is different. So it is different product. There's no one that is what it's broadly. Will a good amount reprice in a month? Yes. Will most of it reprice in 3 months? Absolutely.\n",
       "\n",
       "Abhishek M.: Right. So the cumulative impact will probably be seen in Q1 may not have been seen in Q4 yet, that's the understanding, right?\n",
       "\n",
       "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: That is correct.\n",
       "\n",
       "Abhishek M.: Right. And then just in terms of the...\n",
       "\n",
       "Bhavin Lakhpatwala: Abhishek, also the fact that quarter 4 -- Abhishek, the first repo rate cut happened in February itself. So even the full quarter impact of that you have not seen, you will see that only in the April to June quarter. So you'll see the full 50 basis points impact happening in this quarter, what you've not seen perhaps in the fourth quarter.\n",
       "\n",
       "Abhishek M.: Perfect. Yes. That's what I wanted to clarify. And therefore, in terms of the NIM trajectory, right, 1 Q would anyway not have any benefit from the TD cuts that you are taking now? So there should be a bigger impact in 1Q and then through the year, you would see some benefit of the rate cut, etcetera, that you're taking, that should build up...\n",
       "\n",
       "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: That is correct, but I do not want to talk about it quarter-to-quarter at all. You should look at a year because we do not know what will come next week or next month, so we will handle it as a management appropriately to market needs and customer needs.\n",
       "\n",
       "Abhishek M.: Yes, fair enough. And therefore, in terms of this 2\\% ROA target, let's say, is this like now a 2-year or a 3-year kind of target? Because it will take time for cost of funds to catch up and for policy rates to maybe stabilize at some level. So does this become like a ' 27 or ' 28 kind of target for you?\n",
       "\n",
       "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: I don't want to give you an outlook. And by the way, I do not know where you picked up a target of a $2 \\%$ ROA. We've not specified that. All we specified even in this call earlier was that when you look at the frequency of the $2 \\%$ over the last 10 years or 15 years, the $2 \\%$ has been the maximum frequency at which we have hit on an annual basis. That's what I mentioned.\n",

       "\n",
       "Abhishek M.:\n",
       "\n",
       "Yes. Okay. Fair enough. So let me modify the question. Basically, do you have any other levers in your P\\&L, maybe fees or maybe opex where you could see some improvement from here?\n",
       "\n",
       "We have told you about the opex, right, in terms of how we have made investments, if you think about the branch investments, and so the time for getting some realization benefits as well as the productivity benefits are on the anvil on that. If you look at a 5-year period, 250 branches to 350 branches to 750 to 1,400 -something to 900 to 700 something now. So in terms of the branches, this is the last 5, 6 years, if you see that we have built, right? Even the recent time period, 700 branches, if you see, is almost $2 x$ what we were doing 5 years ago in terms of the branch.\n",
       "\n",
       "So we have accelerated and made those investments. And now we are pressing on that to get better productivity, and thereby, the efficiency to come in. Again, the trajectory of that is not quarter-toquarter, not linear, but the trajectory of that is for the cost to income to improve. And again, one other aspect I do want to tell not just look at cost to income, please look at cost to assets too, where we are the best-in-class in terms of cost to assets at about 1.9-and-change.\n",

       "\n",
       "Yes, exactly. So that is why I was wondering if it can improve even further from here because you're already very efficient when you compare to your peers?\n",
       "\n",
       "We are efficient, and we continue to press on new technologies and press on greater productivity, yes, indeed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Got it. Okay. Thank you so much and all the best.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Harsh Modi from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\n",
       "\n",
       "Yes, hi. Thanks for allowing to ask questions. First is on CASA market share. Could you provide some details over, let's say, next 18 months to 24 months, how do you see your both CA and SA market share evolve and is there any particular number that we could think about in terms of CASA ratio, let's say, over 18 months to 24 months?\n",
       "\n",
       "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: In a different form, it's the same question of an outlook or a target that want us to specify. The opportunity exists. Our total market share is 11. The time deposit or CASA market share is give and take around that level. So which means we are evenly positioned, take time deposit could be 11.5 and CASA could be 10.5 and so somewhere in that level. That's where we are in terms of the market share.\n",
       "\n",
       "The opportunity exists across both of this. I do want one other very important factor to tell and which we have been mentioning over the last 3 years, 4 years. The penetration of time deposit in our customer base is low. So we do see opportunity space for getting better customer relationship through those time deposits. So we cannot leave it on the table to say just because it is time deposit, we don't want.\n",
       "\n",
       "We want that customer relationship because that's based on customer needs. So I cannot tell you that we drive to one ratio and our goal is to have this ratio and so on. Our goal is to have the predominant share, wallet share of the customer whatever comes. And so thereby, that is how it is\n",
       "\n",
       "operated. And that is how the market share, if you see $11 \\%$, either any of these CASA or time deposits hovers around that kind of level.\n",

       "Right. Okay, I understand that, Srini. If I could rephrase the question, especially for savings account market share. Incremental savings account market share over next 18 months to 24 months given your investments in branches that you just explained and technology and best-in-class distribution network, do you expect to gain meaningful market share on savings account in next 18 to 24 month or would you probably just be maintaining your market share over the next 18 to 24 months, how do we think about that?\n",
       "\n",
       "Our ambition and our historical experience has always been to gain market share. That is how we are positioned. How much we gain depends on market conditions at any point in time and the disposable income in the hands of the customers, depending on how the inflation plays out, how the wage growth plays out and so on and so forth and market returns as well as is another aspect of it, yes, which we have seen in the last 12 months when the market returns were high, we have seen some investment into the markets.\n",
       "\n",
       "All right. Thank you.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Param Subramanian from Investec. Please go ahead.\n",
       "\n",
       "Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just a few data-keeping questions. Firstly, what is the maturity of the term deposits on book? I don't mean on sourcing, on book. And similarly how much of your borrowings mature over the course of next year?\n",
       "\n",
       "No, you'll get some of these things you'll get once the annual report is out. We don't have that, some of these things handy because it belongs to multiple buckets that goes through. So on the time deposit, we can't really have a number to give out to say this is a maturity that you're looking for. And sorry the second question.\n",
       "\n",
       "Yes, broad number would also do, Bhavin?\n",
       "\n",
       "No, it's not something which we can just, I mean, difficult to put a number out that way. And sorry, can you repeat the second question again, please?\n",
       "\n",
       "On borrowings over the next 12 months.\n",
       "\n",
       "See, two things on borrowings. There is a maturity profile, which also last time we published, I think it's 0.5 trillion or thereabouts of the legacy bond borrowings will mature. And we will have opportunity space to have some new borrowings, which is infrastructure borrowings, which could be much more cost effective. So it depends on the market rates and there's no one particular strategy. We do the breakeven between certain category of deposits and infrastructure borrowings.\n",
       "\n",
       "And in many instances, we see the infra borrowings could be better. So again, I don't know what the market rate will be when we go to the market, but both of these are -- we will have some borrowings, infra borrowings at a cost-effective way and there will be a certain level of maturity\n",
       "\n",
       "that will happen which is, again 0.5 trillion or thereabouts, that will happen. And keep in mind that the borrowing mix to the total liabilities now stands at about $14 \\%$.\n",
       "\n",
       "Premerger, it was in single digit call it $8 \\%$ or thereabouts $9 \\%$. So ideally, somewhere in the long term, it will transition towards that level. A combination of both balance sheet growth as well as some maturity and replaced modestly with cost-effective borrowings.\n",
       "\n",
       "Param Subramanian: Thanks Srini. Just one additional part. How much of your borrowing is, say, floating rate hedged as we go into this rate cycle, just a relevant question there. And secondly, last quarter, you had given a number on the PSL shortfall in SMF and weaker section being about $1 \\%$, where are we there broadly?\n",
       "\n",
       "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: About that percent-or-so is where it is. We endeavor to close it, but that is always -- we chase volumes at different categories, as I told you on that. Then your first part of the question...\n",
       "\n",
       "Bhavin Lakhpatwala: Is borrowing that hedge? It continues to be around $60 \\%, 65 \\%$ of the borrowings, which will be hedged, which is again from the HDFC Limited book, which is what we've always had that.\n",
       "\n",
       "Param Subramanian: And which is the relevant floating benchmark once you look at...\n",

       "Moderator:\n",

       "Deekshant:\n",
       "\n",
       "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: I guess you are talking about the industry level. You've seen us through various cycles, we've been pretty steady. Our NPAs have been quite steady other than the year or two of COVID. Even those time periods, maybe 20 basis points, it went up, but otherwise we've been operating in a very narrow band on nonperforming loans and so on. I guess your question is more philosophical in terms of what's happening in the industry and where that is heading.\n",
       "\n",
       "If you listen to our Chief Credit Officer, he has done various analysis to say that the credit cycle bottomed out maybe even three quarters ago, four quarters ago and which you have seen at the industry level, the nonperforming loans going up and the credit cost beginning to go up. The offset has always been some of the legacy loans 5 years, 10 years, whatever legacy loans some recoveries and repayments have happened against those.\n",
       "\n",
       "So you don't necessarily see the full effect of that through the P\\&L at the industry level. You don't see that. So whether the credit NPAs and credit costs will normalize over the next 1 year, 3 years, it should, but that should be at a lower level than what historically we have seen is the assessment of our credit officers.\n",

       "To just to add to what Srini is saying. Our segmentation of customers, whether it's corporate, whether it's SME, whether it is retail is very clear. We have tested these segments over a long period of time and we probably have a reasonable fix on the expected loss, credit losses in that. And the opportunity to nibble away more share in these kind of customer segments is huge.\n",
       "\n",
       "As I said, it is up to us the pace at which we want to grow, but it doesn't mean that the proportion of our losses is going to go up just because we are growing fast because we're going to be limiting ourselves only to the segment that we are comfortable to operate.\n",
       "\n",
       "So Srini did allude to it. If you take a 25 -year history of our expect actual credit loss experience adjusted for some of the event risk and also mergers, you will find that we have been virtually on a flat basis or on a straight-line basis across the X axis of the curve.\n",
       "\n",
       "So growth does not mean our losses or loss ratios will go up. I think it should be more or less in a range bound because of the target segment that we would still like to -- because there is opportunity, there's a runway, and we would want to stick to this opportunity and not go down the risk ladders.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir, there is no question that we are the best-in-class when it comes to like loan performances and even the way that we issue the loans. Just to like narrow this question a little bit more: There seems to be an early sign of some sort of SME growth that can come in. Sir, also alluded to that some of the things have bottomed out right now.\n",
       "\n",
       "Considering that SME growth does come in and even the retail loans do start coming in better, namely the home loans, do we think that the incremental growth of market share that we are focusing on will that come at the cost which would be lower on the lower end of our range of our NPA cycle or would that be at a higher end of the range of NPA cycle?\n",
       "\n",
       "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: So getting directly to that question in terms of whether we would go down the credit ladder to pick up the volumes? The short answer is no. Credit policies will not be changed to pick up volumes. They have been stable and they're consistent. And the market opportunity presents very well to capture.\n",
       "\n",
       "In addition to the credit, one other important dimension that determines whether we pick up that loan or not is also the rate at which we can do. And the third dimension that is required is we just not want to be a lending institution to anybody. We want it to be a relationship bank, including SME.\n",
       "\n",
       "We want that proprietor or partners, their family, even if there are 5 employees or 3 employees or 50 employees, their employee account, the primary banking need to be with us. So we are not going to do lending just as a product of lending. It is for the total banking relationship we want from that particular transaction that we go into.\n",
       "\n",
       "Okay. Sir, just one last follow-up here...\n",
       "\n",
       "Deekshant, I request you to join back the queue please as we have other participants waiting.\n",

       "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: See, no, I don't know, but we are not -- we are seeing intense competition. We've not seen anything different now than what we saw 6 months ago from a price competitiveness point of view, let it be mortgage product or auto product and so on. So that's one from an industry point of view. I will not be able to talk about their risk-based pricing model.\n",
       "\n",
       "But for us, we have a band of risk-based pricing product. For a given risk profile what is the kind of a price band that we can operate and that has been consistent and we'll operate in the same manner there.\n",
       "\n",
       "Piran Engineer: Okay. So it's fair to say we've not cut lending rates like in auto loans, etc.?\n",
       "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: No, we've not cut, but we do have a risk-based pricing model for us given a risk profile of a customer. So my profile may be different from my colleague's profile, and so it depends on what it is, so we get different rates.\n",
       "\n",
       "Piran Engineer: Okay. Fair. And sir, just secondly, on your unsecured book of roughly INR2 lakh crores, what percentage would be unsecured business loans? And can you also just talk a bit about this business, the customer profile? Are these repeat loans to existing customers? Or do you also acquire fresh new-to-bank customers through this product?\n",
       "\n",
       "And are there -- like when we have the retail asset quality cycle -- by we, I mean the industry, are there some signs of stress in unsecured business loans? Just an overview of this would be useful.\n",
       "\n",
       "Srinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay, yes. One you see that we published personal loans, which is almost about close to INR2 trillion or-so, right, as of the quarter end INR2 trillion or so. See call it, about $75 \\%, 80 \\%$ of them are salaried customers, mostly salaried with us or if it is taken from the market still salaried. The rest could be the open market loans, which are non-salaried customers.\n",
       "\n",
       "Non-salaried customers could be self-employed, which is some professionals or they're doing certain other activities and so on and so forth, which they may use this for other purposes. Then the third aspect of it is the performance of what this is. No, we've not experienced stress, touch\n",
       "\n",
       "wood, and we see that it's quite strong and very good and operates across several such segments, which is from individuals to proprietors to partners to various.\n",
       "\n",
       "And we operate this in a few segments. We operate this in the retail personal loan segment, we also operate this in the CRB segment and the emerging enterprises, which is business and it can operate for a small merchant to a medium merchant to a larger entity. So across all of these, we can operate there.\n",

Thank you. Good evening, and welcome to all. We have with us Sashi Jagdishan, MD, and CEO. We'll request him to give some opening remarks before we can jump in. Sashi, over to you for any remarks that you have.\\n\\nThank you Srini and thank you all for joining in on a Saturday evening. You probably would have seen the press release and the investor presentation that the team would have put it up. So let me give you a very brief context as to how we have done on a broad basis before Srini takes over some of the finer points. Within the global context, we believe India is well placed. RBI has recently commenced cutting rates.\\n\\nThe moderation in food inflation and headline inflation also augurs well. We've already seen 2 rate cuts and the change in stance from neutral to accommodative is a welcome relief to all of us. RBI intends to increase durable liquidity, which is followed by concrete actions, which, along with rate cuts, will help supporting the GDP growth. For FY '26, we expect the GDP to be supported by a pickup in rural spending, discretionary consumer demand and investment activity.\\n\\nOf course, the goods exports may be impacted until the global trade and tariff situation becomes far more clearer. We acknowledge that the global macroeconomic outlook has become more uncertain due to the recent trade tariff-related measures and the volatility surrounding them. This may potentially impact global inflation leading to lower growth across economies.\\n\\nCorporates have adopted a wait-and-watch stance, and we are waiting for more clarity. We remain watchful. Coming to the bank. As you recall, we spelled it out in Q4 of last year and to be more precise, I think, somewhere around February.\\n\\nWe continue to be on the journey that we spelled out. Our credit deposit ratio has been brought down from the highs at the time of merger, which was at about $110 \\\\%$ to around $96 \\\\%$ as of March 2025. Our deposits have grown faster than the system and so has it grown faster than our loans as well.\\n\\nNext year, in line with what we had committed, the adjustment in CD ratio will not be so steep, supporting the loan growth for the bank, but it will be on a downward path. Cost remains under a tight leash, and we expect this to continue. Asset quality one of our USPs, remains pristine.\\n\\nAs liquidity and growth improve, we are well placed to grow in both assets and deposits. We have been doing a lot of work on technology over the last few years and we should start reaping the benefits of the same gradually during the course of the year. This is a space to watch out for, and we shall unveil at the appropriate time.\", images=[], dimensions=OCRPageDimensions(dpi=200, height=2339, width=1654)), OCRPageObject(index=3, markdown=\"I would like to express my gratitude to all our employees for their hard work and performance and to our shareholders and all of you who are on this call for being very patient with us during this period of adjustment. Thank you so much.\\n\\nSrini, over to you.\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. Thank you, Sashi, for those remarks. With that, we can open it up, and we'll use the time for questions. Please go ahead whoever is on the queue, please.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nChintan Joshi:\\n\\nThank you very much sir. We'll take a first question from the line of Chintan Joshi from Autonomous. Please go ahead.\\n\\nHi, good evening. Can I start with NIM? Some expansion coming through this quarter, if you could explain what the drivers of that expansion was? And also how we can think about NIMs progressing over the next year? On one hand, you've got the rate cuts, but on the other hand, your funding synergies are gradually coming through. Do you think if you see 100 bps rate cycle, NIMs can be higher than where we are today?\\n\\nThat's on NIMs. And then the second question I have is more on the corporate sector. If I look at cash and investments on corporate sector balance sheet over the last 3, 4 years and how they park it in the banking system that's kind of gone up significantly. But these deposits are short term in nature, we don't have the LCR benefit like we have with the household sector, how does the bank take on these deposits? How do they use it?\\n\\nI assume they can't really be used for term lending. It would be helpful to understand in this period where we've got geopolitical uncertainty, there will be even more corporate deposits, how does the banking system or yourselves use that?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. Two things. One is at the macro level. First, I'll take the NIM first. You saw the NIM for us over the last 12 months if you see, operated in a very narrow band, 3.4 to 3.5. Last year, March quarter was 3.44; now on a core basis, 3.46; last quarter was 3.43 and so on, so it's in a very narrow band plus/minus 5 basis points here and there, that's where the NIM has operated. And if you look at the components of the NIM, one is the cost of funds, which is in one of our pages where we published that, which is I think is on Page number 15, I think it is in our deck.\\n\\nThe cost of funds is also very stable at about 4.9. And there are two things going on in the cost of funds to be stable there. One is the borrowing mix has come down during this time period, whatever is on the page there, you see that the borrowing mix in the first of the time period, December ' 23 was $21 \\\\%$ and then from then on last March, it was $18 \\\\%$ and now it is $14 \\\\%$ borrowing mix. So that's one of the tailwind that contributed as a positive item to the cost of funds.\\n\\nThen there is a headwind in the cost of funds we have seen is the customer preference towards time deposit. If you see the rate of growth even in the recent time period, time deposit rate of growth, INR2 trillion in a full year time period. In the quarter, this quarter, recent quarter, about INR0.8 trillion time deposit rate of growth, 20\\\\%-or-so, right? So we have seen that.\", images=[], dimensions=OCRPageDimensions(dpi=200, height=2339, width=1654)), OCRPageObject(index=4, markdown=\"So the CASA ratio mix has not been favorable. It's an adverse variance there, right? But between all of these, the cost of funds, we kept it stable by selecting retail deposits and not pricing up on the nonretail deposits, and we'll come to the second aspect of what you asked.\\n\\nSo the nonretail we've been circumspect, even I think it's going back to almost December '23, that time period itself, we saw that the pricing on the nonretail deposit was unacceptably high and competitive without consideration for the liquidity lendable value of those deposits. So we remain circumspect and didn't price, but try to manage it in a way that it's in a very narrow band there.\\n\\nNow come to the yield on assets, the other component of the NIM before we get to the conclusion of what you'd asked. So if you look at the yield on assets, they've also been pretty stable between $8.3 \\\\%, 8.4 \\\\%$ that's the level at which we operated and that's how we manage that.\\n\\nNow yield on assets if you see here, the retail will give more yield than the nonretail because then you'll have to pay through credit cost in some manner now or at some point in time. But we have had a balanced growth there to manage this yield in a very stable band there.\\n\\nAnd again selection, we have seen over the last 12 months, 18 months, the corporate loans of the larger ticket corporate loans and the larger ticket SME loans, have been very competitive, particularly coming from certain public sector institutions where the growth is an objective and not necessarily margin or returns, we have seen that pricing is very, very low on those.\\n\\nI mean the loan spreads have been very low compared to the bond spreads. That means when the bond spreads moves up or down, the loan spreads is not moving, it's actually coming down, which is what we are seeing. Now we try to manage it through appropriate selection, both -- quality is, of course, the first criteria for selection. Quality passes, it has to pass the rate and if it doesn't passes, we were happy to let go and not necessarily bulk up the balance sheet because we said we can reposition the balance sheet and grow the loans at any time. So that's how we manage that.\\n\\nNow coming to what's happened in the recent time period; 3, 4 basis points always moves at any time for various reasons. So there's no one particular one we can say. Of course, there is a cash reserve ratio that changed sometime in December. So there was some positive impact last quarter and the balance of the positive impact in this quarter, call it, a couple of basis points.\\n\\nAnd then a few basis points moves up and down. There is no kind of a finesse. And similarly, when the NPA changes, lower agriculture in the March quarter that also is a good kind of a margin benefit you get to some extent, but they're all within a narrow band.\\n\\nNow where does it go? I don't want to provide an outlook where this goes. But all I want to tell you is that I described to you this long to tell you how we think about margin and how we manage, which is policy rates change, so the loans that are linked to policy rates like the repo rate gets changed right away, so which is a headwind.\\n\\nAnd the faster the policy rate changes, it starts to factor in faster. The deposit side or the funding side rates take time to factor it in. So I would urge not to look at quarter-to-quarter because it's not something that could be managed at all because the policy can change tomorrow and then the deposit rates can change over time.\", images=[], dimensions=OCRPageDimensions(dpi=200, height=2339, width=1654)), OCRPageObject(index=5, markdown=\"So you have to look at it at least a year or longer than a year to see how stable and how we are managing that margin level, which is what on the page that you are seeing shows that Page 15 at that kind of a level stability how it gets managed. That's the first part. The second part is you talked about the cash and investment and the corporate sector balance sheet, how it gets deployed.\\n\\nAgain, the first part I tried to answer that certain categories of deposits have lower lendable value and the market doesn't price appropriately for that lendable value because that's how it should be. Typically, those kind of segmented deposits should be lower than a retail because the retail is the highest lendable value you can get. But these type of deposits are priced far higher than the retail deposits. So thereby only for large relationships, and where we could get certain other product mix aligned well, we patronize and participate.\\n\\nAnd there are certain other institutions like affiliated institutions to large corporates that we patronize and hold it. That's because we want to keep the wallet share on our lending. We are the largest working capital bank in the country, so we want to keep that wallet share growing in a reasonable manner. So we participate to some extent on these. Otherwise, we don't bid for these kind of deposits.\\n\\nModerator: $\\\\quad$ Thank you. We'll take the next question from the line of Mahrukh Adajania from Nuvama. Please go ahead.\\n\\nMahrukh Adajania: Good evening and congratulations. I had two questions. The first one is on deposit growth. So large banks have cut deposit rates in the most popular buckets by 30 to 45 bps , which is of course transmission, but are you comfortable that the liquidity position has changed enough to support a healthy deposit growth for the system and yourself? Because tight liquidity was really a big issue for the last 1.5 years, except in the last 2 to 3 months. So that's my first question.\\n\\nAnd my second question is on your priority progress. Of course, your CRB has been growing faster than your other loans. But if at all there are any shortfalls, how would that be managed? Would that have any ROA impact, so just a focused discussion on how priority will be managed?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. First is if I get on the rates and deposits as such, right? One is that it's not -- the deposit rate change, if you noticed, while we may have had gone first or second or whatever it is, across the industry, you're seeing -- at least the large top 3, 5 players you are seeing responded to the policy rate change. So that's something that was part of the transmission process.\\n\\nThe loan transmission for good amount happens automatically because of the linked to policy rates. And on the deposit side, one has to manage it and announce it after deliberation. So you have seen that happen. So there is no change as such from a competitive positioning or whatever.\\n\\nAll that differentiates with that ability to reach, that means have the distribution reach, bring in new customers, have better engagement through the RMs, that's been what we have done in the past, that's how we have grown, if you see the past year, rate of deposit growth about 15.8\\\\%-orso, that's INR3.4 trillion in the year. So we continue to be optimistic and continue to have that approach of energy to get that market share gaining, right?\", images=[], dimensions=OCRPageDimensions(dpi=200, height=2339, width=1654)), OCRPageObject(index=6, markdown=\"So the rate is not a differentiator in the past, and we don't think rate is a differentiator to win something because that would be very transitional and a short-term approach to getting that. So that's one on deposits, right? We continue to be playing on an even field there, and we're confident of how we are positioned for that. Second aspect of what you asked is the priority sector lending.\\n\\nWhile the priority sector details get published in the annual report, but nevertheless, at an aggregate level, as we have said in the past, we do meet that $40 \\\\%$ that is required. We're slightly above that level in terms of the aggregate priority sector lending. There are two sub-segments, which is the small and marginal farmer segment and a weaker section that always calls for something that inorganically, that means how do we go and buy it in the market either through certificates, IBPC, PTCs or any other manner or through on-lending program.\\n\\nThere are several instruments that we use and we keep on. And if none of those economics work well, there is always the last resort is the RIDF. That's not our first -- if you don't get any of these done, then there is RIDF, right? If you look at the cost dynamics of any of these things, they all work almost very similar dynamics to the overall P\\\\&L. You rightfully so touched up on returns. What does it mean to returns? Whether you have one or the other instrument, the impact on the return is very similar, there's no difference. And that is what historically also we have done.\\n\\nEven if you look at the year that has gone by, we were about $1 \\\\%$-or-so short on these kind of segments. And even now, we continue to look for and search for how to close in that last $1 \\\\%$ across SMF for the weaker and we will endeavor to do and close as much as we can. If not, the alternatives are already there, yes.\\n\\nMahrukh Adajania: Okay, perfect. Thank you.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nAnand Swaminathan:\\n\\nI have a couple of questions. Sashi, first question is on CRB. There has been a lot of media noise around senior management and some changes. It would be great if you could give us some confidence around what's happening and give us some clarity around that?\\n\\nThat's number one. And number two, on ROAs. We have successfully defended the $1.8 \\\\%$ ROA we've been guiding for the last several quarters. Srini, as we go into the rate cut cycle and growth slightly improving in the FY '26, do we have enough levers to defend this $1.8 \\\\%$ level or we should expect a brief kind of decline and then come back above $1.8 \\\\%$ when growth eventually recovers?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. I'm going to get it started first in terms of what it is, right? See, if you see, we had a reorganization. And Rahul Shukla who heads the commercial and rural banking had taken personal time off and is on sabbatical, right? So he's taken some time off or whatever, family reasons and so on. And the reorganization is expected to accomplish a few things, right?\\n\\nOne is, if you see what is going on particularly in the rural segment, take -- example, I'll give you the -- how we are thinking about to drive certain synergy and capture the growth opportunity and bring some productivity, right?\", images=[], dimensions=OCRPageDimensions(dpi=200, height=2339, width=1654)), OCRPageObject(index=7, markdown=\"So that's both from a customer point of view, better engagement; and from people point of view, better productivity and what does it do to get that. One is, simple thing, if you take about agriculture, that's now part of the retail management team who handled the two-wheeler and auto business and so on, that's the same kind of a leadership that handles agriculture. So once we reach the farmer, you know that as part of the prior growth approach, we expanded our geographical reach to 2.25 lakh -- 225,000 villages.\\n\\nNow the next phase of this growth is having a presence there, we need to go capture the volumes, that is reach out in the vicinity of those villages the right kind of farmer to bring in. So right now, we envisage not to just do an agriculture loan because that particular town, that farmer, that family and the neighbors do need a 2 -wheeler, do need a car, auto loan and so on and so forth.\\n\\nSo under the same team that we are trying to get these kind of multiple products made available to them. And also, if you look at where this particular thing is positioned, it's also positioned alongside the gold loan business. You know that in the country, a lot of farmers have gold and use gold for financing appropriately and perhaps rightfully so to fund the requirements of the farm.\\n\\nAnd so now these synergies are expected. And what does it do? It enables us to have a frequent connect with that farmer and that community in the rural segment through these kind of products which we are having. So it enhances our periodicity at which we will touch that customer. And so since we are delivering multiple products to the same customer, we do anticipate this is supposed to give better people productivity.\\n\\nSo I gave you one example, and that's how if you look at anything, all of those things that we have done is expected to provide the significant lift in productivity across all of these product and geography and customer segments that we are operating. So that's one, I hope, that gives you the context of the CRB, what goes on...\\n\\nSashidhar Jagdishan:\\n\\nSrini, I would like to add to whatever you have said. Rahul was one of our very good business managers. And obviously, he did express, as Srini mentioned, his desire to go on a sabbatical because he had some personal matters to attend to with his family and the academics of his children.\\n\\nBut having said that, he built a very strong team. And as you probably heard Srini, we have reorganized the entire asset side of the balance sheet under an even more abler individual. As you know, Kaizad now handles the entire asset side of the balance sheet and the investment banking business. And all the heads who have been with us, we have, as we have mentioned several times in the past, we have a very good depth in management and they now all of them have now handle larger businesses and report to the Deputy Managing Director.\\n\\nI'm quite excited about this reorganization, and I'm sure that we will harness the most optimal way to find growth and as Srini mentioned, synergies between various asset groups so that we can optimize even our resources at the grassroots levels, so that there is not too much of an overlap. So this is going to be a very exciting period for us, and you will start to see a lot more efficiencies and even greater hunger than what we have seen from the CRB and the entire asset side of the balance sheet.\", images=[], dimensions=OCRPageDimensions(dpi=200, height=2339, width=1654)), OCRPageObject(index=8, markdown=\"Obviously, optimizing yields, optimizing the need to maintain priority sector requirements and other aspects as well. So this is a year to watch out for in terms of the kind of benefits that will accrue from this so-called massive reorganization that we have undertaken during the year. Yes, Srini, over to you.\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: Yes. Thank you for that additional color. Very good. Now getting to your second aspect of ROA. See, if you see our ROA has operated around that 1.9 level, right, plus/minus a few basis points. Ever since we accomplished the merger July 1, 2023, it's been approximately around that level, right? We're consistently delivering there.\\n\\nWhen you had asked about what does it do in a different rate scenario, if whatever happens? I talked about the margin in a couple of questions before in terms of how we think about the margin to be within a stable range, right? So ROA similarly can move around 5, 10 basis points.\\n\\nOur long-term average of ROA, if you see, somewhere, I think we have published that also. Over a 10-year, 15-year period, if you see, anywhere between a merger or pre-merger or post-merger, any which way if you look at it, 1.9 to 2.1 .\\n\\nAnd for many instances, the frequency of two is the highest. And sometimes we'd had 1.9 and sometimes we'd 2.1. So that is the optimal level, right, at which it operates. If the ROA tends for better cost of credit or better margin that comes through and for cost efficiency and so on, to some extent, there is always a reinvestment opportunity because at the end of the day, our market share on deposits is 11 .\\n\\nOur market share on distribution, which is branches is $6 \\\\%$ and our market share on loans is $14 \\\\%$. So we still have enormous room and a need to make investments, pace those investments appropriately to keep growing for the long term. So that's in that narrow band that we operate. So there is no one particular -- can we have a 10 basis points change in a year possible? Absolutely possible. But can it be far higher than that? Not likely, right? Because we have operated in a stable band up or down.\\n\\nModerator: Thank you.\\n\\nAnand Swaminathan: Thank you Srini. That is very useful. Just a quick follow-up...\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nRikin Shah:\\n\\nI request you to join back the queue for follow-up question, please, as we have other participants waiting for their turn. Thank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Rikin Shah from IIFL. Please go ahead.\\n\\nThank you for the opportunity. Two quick questions. First one for the repo-link loans. Do they get repriced immediately as soon as the repo rate changes? Or is there usually a lag of a few months from the change of repo rate? And secondly, an extension to this, does the number of days impact your reported margins? That's the first question. And the second one is, was there any reversal on AIF provisions in this quarter? Those are my two questions.\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. So in terms of the timing of the repo rate change and so thereby the transmission or flowthrough, by product, it is different. If you think about mortgages, which is $30 \\\\%$ of the book-or-so,\", images=[], dimensions=OCRPageDimensions(dpi=200, height=2339, width=1654)), OCRPageObject(index=9, markdown=\"it can happen in the immediate cycle, rate changes and in the following month cycle, it can happen. So it can be anywhere within a month, it can happen. If you look at corporate loan or something, it can happen immediately.\\n\\nSo it depends on product to product and the contractual arrangements, which are there in terms of the repricing frequency. But no -- it will not be a kind of an annual or something like that. It can be a month, it can be a quarter, but not something that it takes a year to get that transmitted. And your second aspect of number of days, yes, it can be a couple of basis points, it happens all the time. And yes, that's possible.\\n\\nRikin Shah: Got it. And the reversal of AIF provision, please?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: AIF, there's nothing significant in this quarter in terms of the contingency. If you remember the AIF provision that we had last financial year, not the one that ended, was about INR1,200 croresor-so. Then after the RBI clarification in the beginning of the recent financial year, it was taken down. And then depending on the volumes that move up and down, it moves, but there's nothing significant as such on that, yes.\\n\\nRikin Shah: Okay. The context of this question, Srini, was that in Note number 15 to your results, it says that AIF-related provision stock is around INR288 crores right now. The last quarter, it read around INR350 crores. So I just wanted to clarify, was there any reversal or just some of the AIF investments matured and hence, you were not required to carry them?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: So yes, it was not required, but then it didn't survive to the P\\\\&L to the bottom because there are so many ins and outs that happens in the provision. So the way of contingent provision didn't happen because at the end, there was some net addition of INR60 crores for various other reasons. So it didn't survive to the P\\\\&L to the bottom line, yes.\\n\\nRikin Shah: Understood. Thank you very much.\\n\\nModerator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Kunal Shah from Citigroup. Please go ahead.\\n\\nKunal Shah: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. A couple of questions. So firstly, again, sorry to harp again on margins. But the way you have been indicating the balance sheet construct is such that we should be able to operate margins within a narrow band, does that really change with the relatively higher repo rate cut? Or do we have additional levers to still manage margins relatively better compared to that of peers?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: Yes. That's a good question, Kunal. Thanks for asking that. One is that when the policy rate changes in a steady manner over a longer period of time, you know that the adjustment that is required from a cost of funds catches up to neutralize -- to keep the margin safe. But if in quick succession the policy rate changes, then the matching of the cost of funds takes longer time. So that means you cannot look at whether it is in a narrow band in a quarter-to-quarter period. But when you look at a year, you will be able to see that it is in a very narrow band.\", images=[], dimensions=OCRPageDimensions(dpi=200, height=2339, width=1654)), OCRPageObject(index=10, markdown=\"Kunal Shah:\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan:\\n\\nKunal Shah:\\n\\nSure. So on CASA, we have been indicating that in the falling interest rate cycle, generally, we would tend to improve the CASA, but the rate action both on the savings as well as FD seems to be almost similar or savings is relatively higher, then would it be fair to assume that maybe the overall structurally declining SA that phase can very much continue?\\n\\nAnd maybe a follow-up on the LDR. When you indicated that now LDR we will not see a steep decline, are we changing a stance that we need to get it to the premerger level at an accelerated pace and maybe even if it holds relatively higher at 90,92 , we would be comfortable then over the next 18,24 months?\\n\\nOkay. First is the CASA. I do want to go back to describing that, right? The empirical study, both industry as well as for us, which is published CASA ratio and the policy rates if you see over a 15 year period through the up and down rate cycle, the CASA has moved in the opposite direction, which is when the rate goes up, CASA ratio goes down; and the rate starts to come down, there is some lag. It's not instantaneous. A few quarters lag, the CASA starts to go up.\\n\\nSo you'll see that if you map us over a 15 -year period and the industry, you'll see that it moves up and down. So we do -- if the empirical is repeated, there is no reason to believe that it would not be the same or we're not seeing something different as such, we should get the CASA back, but not in a hurry, right? Because there have been 2 rate cuts that have happened. We need to wait and see how this stabilizes, what the global macro effects, what it plays in the country, both from an inflation cost and purchasing power of people.\\n\\nWe need to see how all of those plays out, which you have seen in the last 12, 18 months that middle to the lower segment did not have adequate disposable income to be put in savings because they were using it for their day-to-day needs. So that's why you saw CASA had one more nuance to it that it came down, right? People had less to save. They were spending on certain things and money was moving from household to non-household and so on and so forth. So that's in terms of the CASA as such.\\n\\nAnd LDR?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: LDR, I'll take a shot at it to see. See, what we had described, Kunal, last quarter or even about a year ago is that the LDR will come down to the premerger level, 85 to 90 ; more precisely, it was 87 -and-change the quarter before the merger, 85 to 90 is what we have operated, that will come into that range in FY '27.\\n\\nSo that is why we saw that the loan growth in this year that went by, FY '25, will be lower than the prior year for the industry and we took that opportunity, both industry loan growth going down and pricing being not to our liking, we accelerated to say, let's take this opportunity to slow down even further. So we grew at $7.7 \\\\%$, the assets under management in this recent time period.\\n\\nWe have also indicated that in FY '26, we are subject to appropriate pricing, quality is always given, appropriate pricing that we will be growing at the market rate of growth. If you see the recent quarter that went by, March quarter ' 25 , our sequential momentum growth was about $3.3 \\\\%$, which call it approximately annualized $12 \\\\%$ or $13 \\\\%$ thereabout.\", images=[], dimensions=OCRPageDimensions(dpi=200, height=2339, width=1654)), OCRPageObject(index=11, markdown=\"So I'm not giving you an outlook of what you should expect, I'm just describing what happened in the recent time period and that's the kind of velocity at which it was growing. So we do expect that FY ' 27 is when it will come below that 90 mark. So at this moment, there is no other approach that we are having. And we continue to power on getting the right kind of deposits at the right price to keep that leadership position and gaining market share on deposits.\\n\\nModerator: We'll take our next question from the line of Abhishek M. from HSBC.\\n\\nAbhishek M.: So a couple of very quick clarifications and then one question. The first is when you say repo cut gets passed on right away, does it happen exactly right away or does it happen on a particular day in a month or a particular day in a quarter? When does the transmission actually happen?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: It can happen -- if your repricing date is set for 15th, it is 15th. If Bhavin's reset date is set for 25th, it is 25 th. If my reset date is 5 th, it is 5 th. And it depends product to product. And that means the mortgage product is different. Wholesale product is different. SME product is different. So it is different product. There's no one that is what it's broadly. Will a good amount reprice in a month? Yes. Will most of it reprice in 3 months? Absolutely.\\n\\nAbhishek M.: Right. So the cumulative impact will probably be seen in Q1 may not have been seen in Q4 yet, that's the understanding, right?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: That is correct.\\n\\nAbhishek M.: Right. And then just in terms of the...\\n\\nBhavin Lakhpatwala: Abhishek, also the fact that quarter 4 -- Abhishek, the first repo rate cut happened in February itself. So even the full quarter impact of that you have not seen, you will see that only in the April to June quarter. So you'll see the full 50 basis points impact happening in this quarter, what you've not seen perhaps in the fourth quarter.\\n\\nAbhishek M.: Perfect. Yes. That's what I wanted to clarify. And therefore, in terms of the NIM trajectory, right, 1 Q would anyway not have any benefit from the TD cuts that you are taking now? So there should be a bigger impact in 1Q and then through the year, you would see some benefit of the rate cut, etcetera, that you're taking, that should build up...\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: That is correct, but I do not want to talk about it quarter-to-quarter at all. You should look at a year because we do not know what will come next week or next month, so we will handle it as a management appropriately to market needs and customer needs.\\n\\nAbhishek M.: Yes, fair enough. And therefore, in terms of this 2\\\\% ROA target, let's say, is this like now a 2-year or a 3-year kind of target? Because it will take time for cost of funds to catch up and for policy rates to maybe stabilize at some level. So does this become like a ' 27 or ' 28 kind of target for you?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: I don't want to give you an outlook. And by the way, I do not know where you picked up a target of a $2 \\\\%$ ROA. We've not specified that. All we specified even in this call earlier was that when you look at the frequency of the $2 \\\\%$ over the last 10 years or 15 years, the $2 \\\\%$ has been the maximum frequency at which we have hit on an annual basis.

Basically, do you have any other levers in your P\\\\&L, maybe fees or maybe opex where you could see some improvement from here?\\n\\nWe have told you about the opex, right, in terms of how we have made investments, if you think about the branch investments, and so the time for getting some realization benefits as well as the productivity benefits are on the anvil on that. If you look at a 5-year period, 250 branches to 350 branches to 750 to 1,400 -something to 900 to 700 something now. So in terms of the branches, this is the last 5, 6 years, if you see that we have built, right? Even the recent time period, 700 branches, if you see, is almost $2 x$ what we were doing 5 years ago in terms of the branch.\\n\\nSo we have accelerated and made those investments. And now we are pressing on that to get better productivity, and thereby, the efficiency to come in. Again, the trajectory of that is not quarter-toquarter, not linear, but the trajectory of that is for the cost to income to improve. And again, one other aspect I do want to tell not just look at cost to income, please look at cost to assets too, where we are the best-in-class in terms of cost to assets at about 1.9-and-change.\\n\\nAbhishek M.:\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan:\\n\\nAbhishek M:\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nHarsh Modi:\\n\\nYes, exactly. So that is why I was wondering if it can improve even further from here because you're already very efficient when you compare to your peers?\\n\\nWe are efficient, and we continue to press on new technologies and press on greater productivity, yes, indeed.\\n\\nGot it. Okay. Thank you so much and all the best.\\n\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Harsh Modi from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\\n\\nYes, hi. Thanks for allowing to ask questions. First is on CASA market share. Could you provide some details over, let's say, next 18 months to 24 months, how do you see your both CA and SA market share evolve and is there any particular number that we could think about in terms of CASA ratio, let's say, over 18 months to 24 months?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: In a different form, it's the same question of an outlook or a target that want us to specify. The opportunity exists. Our total market share is 11. The time deposit or CASA market share is give and take around that level. So which means we are evenly positioned, take time deposit could be 11.5 and CASA could be 10.5 and so somewhere in that level. That's where we are in terms of the market share.\\n\\nThe opportunity exists across both of this. I do want one other very important factor to tell and which we have been mentioning over the last 3 years, 4 years. The penetration of time deposit in our customer base is low. So we do see opportunity space for getting better customer relationship through those time deposits. So we cannot leave it on the table to say just because it is time deposit, we don't want.\\n\\nWe want that customer relationship because that's based on customer needs. So I cannot tell you that we drive to one ratio and our goal is to have this ratio and so on. Our goal is to have the predominant share, wallet share of the customer whatever comes. And so thereby, that is how it is\", images=[], dimensions=OCRPageDimensions(dpi=200, height=2339, width=1654)), OCRPageObject(index=13, markdown=\"operated. And that is how the market share, if you see $11 \\\\%$, either any of these CASA or time deposits hovers around that kind of level.\\n\\nHarsh Modi:\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan:\\n\\nHarsh Modi:\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nParam Subramanian:\\n\\nBhavin Lakhpatwala:\\n\\nParam Subramanian:\\n\\nBhavin Lakhpatwala:\\n\\nParam Subramanian:\\n\\nRight. Okay, I understand that, Srini. If I could rephrase the question, especially for savings account market share. Incremental savings account market share over next 18 months to 24 months given your investments in branches that you just explained and technology and best-in-class distribution network, do you expect to gain meaningful market share on savings account in next 18 to 24 month or would you probably just be maintaining your market share over the next 18 to 24 months, how do we think about that?\\n\\nOur ambition and our historical experience has always been to gain market share. That is how we are positioned. How much we gain depends on market conditions at any point in time and the disposable income in the hands of the customers, depending on how the inflation plays out, how the wage growth plays out and so on and so forth and market returns as well as is another aspect of it, yes, which we have seen in the last 12 months when the market returns were high, we have seen some investment into the markets.\\n\\nAll right. Thank you.\\n\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Param Subramanian from Investec. Please go ahead.\\n\\nHi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just a few data-keeping questions. Firstly, what is the maturity of the term deposits on book? I don't mean on sourcing, on book. And similarly how much of your borrowings mature over the course of next year?\\n\\nNo, you'll get some of these things you'll get once the annual report is out. We don't have that, some of these things handy because it belongs to multiple buckets that goes through. So on the time deposit, we can't really have a number to give out to say this is a maturity that you're looking for. And sorry the second question.\\n\\nYes, broad number would also do, Bhavin?\\n\\nNo, it's not something which we can just, I mean, difficult to put a number out that way. And sorry, can you repeat the second question again, please?\\n\\nOn borrowings over the next 12 months.\\n\\nSee, two things on borrowings. There is a maturity profile, which also last time we published, I think it's 0.5 trillion or thereabouts of the legacy bond borrowings will mature. And we will have opportunity space to have some new borrowings, which is infrastructure borrowings, which could be much more cost effective. So it depends on the market rates and there's no one particular strategy. We do the breakeven between certain category of deposits and infrastructure borrowings.\\n\\nAnd in many instances, we see the infra borrowings could be better. So again, I don't know what the market rate will be when we go to the market, but both of these are -- we will have some borrowings, infra borrowings at a cost-effective way and there will be a certain level of maturity\", images=[], dimensions=OCRPageDimensions(dpi=200, height=2339, width=1654)), OCRPageObject(index=14, markdown=\"that will happen which is, again 0.5 trillion or thereabouts, that will happen. And keep in mind that the borrowing mix to the total liabilities now stands at about $14 \\\\%$.\\n\\nPremerger, it was in single digit call it $8 \\\\%$ or thereabouts $9 \\\\%$. So ideally, somewhere in the long term, it will transition towards that level. A combination of both balance sheet growth as well as some maturity and replaced modestly with cost-effective borrowings.\\n\\nParam Subramanian: Thanks Srini. Just one additional part. How much of your borrowing is, say, floating rate hedged as we go into this rate cycle, just a relevant question there. And secondly, last quarter, you had given a number on the PSL shortfall in SMF and weaker section being about $1 \\\\%$, where are we there broadly?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: About that percent-or-so is where it is. We endeavor to close it, but that is always -- we chase volumes at different categories, as I told you on that. Then your first part of the question...\\n\\nBhavin Lakhpatwala: Is borrowing that hedge? It continues to be around $60 \\\\%, 65 \\\\%$ of the borrowings, which will be hedged, which is again from the HDFC Limited book, which is what we've always had that.\\n\\nParam Subramanian: And which is the relevant floating benchmark once you look at...\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nDeekshant:\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: I guess you are talking about the industry level. You've seen us through various cycles, we've been pretty steady. Our NPAs have been quite steady other than the year or two of COVID. Even those time periods, maybe 20 basis points, it went up, but otherwise we've been operating in a very narrow band on nonperforming loans and so on. I guess your question is more philosophical in terms of what's happening in the industry and where that is heading.\\n\\nIf you listen to our Chief Credit Officer, he has done various analysis to say that the credit cycle bottomed out maybe even three quarters ago, four quarters ago and which you have seen at the industry level, the nonperforming loans going up and the credit cost beginning to go up. The offset has always been some of the legacy loans 5 years, 10 years, whatever legacy loans some recoveries and repayments have happened against those.\\n\\nSo you don't necessarily see the full effect of that through the P\\\\&L at the industry level. You don't see that. So whether the credit NPAs and credit costs will normalize over the next 1 year, 3 years, it should, but that should be at a lower level than what historically we have seen is the assessment of our credit officers.\", images=[], dimensions=OCRPageDimensions(dpi=200, height=2339, width=1654)), OCRPageObject(index=15, markdown=\"Sashidhar Jagdishan:\\n\\nDeekshant:\\n\\nDeekshant:\\n\\nDeekshant:\\n\\nTo just to add to what Srini is saying. Our segmentation of customers, whether it's corporate, whether it's SME, whether it is retail is very clear. We have tested these segments over a long period of time and we probably have a reasonable fix on the expected loss, credit losses in that. And the opportunity to nibble away more share in these kind of customer segments is huge.\\n\\nAs I said, it is up to us the pace at which we want to grow, but it doesn't mean that the proportion of our losses is going to go up just because we are growing fast because we're going to be limiting ourselves only to the segment that we are comfortable to operate.\\n\\nSo Srini did allude to it. If you take a 25 -year history of our expect actual credit loss experience adjusted for some of the event risk and also mergers, you will find that we have been virtually on a flat basis or on a straight-line basis across the X axis of the curve.\\n\\nSo growth does not mean our losses or loss ratios will go up. I think it should be more or less in a range bound because of the target segment that we would still like to -- because there is opportunity, there's a runway, and we would want to stick to this opportunity and not go down the risk ladders.\\n\\nSir, there is no question that we are the best-in-class when it comes to like loan performances and even the way that we issue the loans. Just to like narrow this question a little bit more: There seems to be an early sign of some sort of SME growth that can come in. Sir, also alluded to that some of the things have bottomed out right now.\\n\\nConsidering that SME growth does come in and even the retail loans do start coming in better, namely the home loans, do we think that the incremental growth of market share that we are focusing on will that come at the cost which would be lower on the lower end of our range of our NPA cycle or would that be at a higher end of the range of NPA cycle?\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: So getting directly to that question in terms of whether we would go down the credit ladder to pick up the volumes? The short answer is no. Credit policies will not be changed to pick up volumes. They have been stable and they're consistent. And the market opportunity presents very well to capture.\\n\\nIn addition to the credit, one other important dimension that determines whether we pick up that loan or not is also the rate at which we can do. And the third dimension that is required is we just not want to be a lending institution to anybody. We want it to be a relationship bank, including SME.\\n\\nWe want that proprietor or partners, their family, even if there are 5 employees or 3 employees or 50 employees, their employee account, the primary banking need to be with us. So we are not going to do lending just as a product of lending. It is for the total banking relationship we want from that particular transaction that we go into.\\n\\nOkay. Sir, just one last follow-up here...\\n\\nDeekshant, I request you to join back the queue please as we have other participants waiting.\", images=[], dimensions=OCRPageDimensions(dpi=200, height=2339, width=1654)), OCRPageObject(index=16, markdown=\"| Deekshant: | No problem.

Please go <br> ahead. |\\n| Piran Engineer: | Congrats on the very strong numbers. Firstly, I know it's early days, but have we started cutting <br> lending rates on fixed-rate products... |\\n| Moderator: | I'm sorry, Piran, your voice is breaking. |\\n| Piran Engineer: | Is it audible now operator? |\\n| Moderator: | Yes, please go ahead. Yes. |\\n| Piran Engineer: | So congrats on the quarter. My first question is, has the industry or have we started cutting lending <br> rates on fixed rate products like vehicle loans or personal loans after the 50 bps repo rate cut? |\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: See, no, I don't know, but we are not -- we are seeing intense competition. We've not seen anything different now than what we saw 6 months ago from a price competitiveness point of view, let it be mortgage product or auto product and so on. So that's one from an industry point of view. I will not be able to talk about their risk-based pricing model.\\n\\nBut for us, we have a band of risk-based pricing product. For a given risk profile what is the kind of a price band that we can operate and that has been consistent and we'll operate in the same manner there.\\n\\nPiran Engineer: Okay. So it's fair to say we've not cut lending rates like in auto loans, etc.?\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: No, we've not cut, but we do have a risk-based pricing model for us given a risk profile of a customer. So my profile may be different from my colleague's profile, and so it depends on what it is, so we get different rates.\\n\\nPiran Engineer: Okay. Fair. And sir, just secondly, on your unsecured book of roughly INR2 lakh crores, what percentage would be unsecured business loans? And can you also just talk a bit about this business, the customer profile? Are these repeat loans to existing customers? Or do you also acquire fresh new-to-bank customers through this product?\\n\\nAnd are there -- like when we have the retail asset quality cycle -- by we, I mean the industry, are there some signs of stress in unsecured business loans? Just an overview of this would be useful.\\n\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay, yes. One you see that we published personal loans, which is almost about close to INR2 trillion or-so, right, as of the quarter end INR2 trillion or so. See call it, about $75 \\\\%, 80 \\\\%$ of them are salaried customers, mostly salaried with us or if it is taken from the market still salaried. The rest could be the open market loans, which are non-salaried customers.\\n\\nNon-salaried customers could be self-employed, which is some professionals or they're doing certain other activities and so on and so forth, which they may use this for other purposes. Then the third aspect of it is the performance of what this is. No, we've not experienced stress, touch\", images=[], dimensions=OCRPageDimensions(dpi=200, height=2339, width=1654)), OCRPageObject(index=17, markdown=\"wood, and we see that it's quite strong and very good and operates across several such segments, which is from individuals to proprietors to partners to various.\\n\\nAnd we operate this in a few segments. We operate this in the retail personal loan segment, we also operate this in the CRB segment and the emerging enterprises, which is business and it can operate for a small merchant to a medium merchant to a larger entity.
